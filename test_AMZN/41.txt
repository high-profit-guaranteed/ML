Promising review: "This has been a wonderful product! I was a little skeptical because of the price, and our pit has skin issues, as a lot of pits do, but this works great. He was going out and getting very pink colored on the white parts of his coat, becoming even more itchy than usual with his skin issues, and you could tell it was bothersome. I asked my vet about this, and she said it was OK to use, so I tried it a little bit first to see if he had any issues. There were none, so I used it all over. I couldn’t believe the difference! This is definitely worth the price! He can now go out even in the hot sun (of course, with breaks) and not get pinkish/red all where the white is. He knows he has to get it on and really doesn’t like it but he doesn’t like baths, rain, or to be wet at all. Once it’s put on, I let him sit inside or in the shade for it to dry before going out in sun exposure, just as I do for regular sunscreen, and it seems to work great. I could tell a difference when my husband took him out without it; you could see he was pink again compared to going out with it on." —Awesome amazon customer
