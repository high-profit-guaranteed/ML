Memorial Day weekend is still days away, but Amazon is bucking convention by dropping a bounty of new deals on tech, with everything from smartphones to smart TVs scoring massive discounts for a limited time.

Rather than scrolling through Amazon's official list of deals, we've decided to save you the trouble by collecting five of our favorite Memorial Day deals below. The list includes offers like a whopping 49% off the Beats Studio Pro wireless headphones, or this deal on the new Google Pixel 8a that comes with a free $100 gift card. There's plenty more where that came from, so keep reading for a deep dive into our top five.
• Phones: up to 38% off Motorola, Samsung phones
• Smart Home: up to 50% off Blink cameras, Ring, and more
• Chromebooks / laptops: up to 17% off ASUS, HP, Lenovo
• Wireless headphones / earbuds: up to 49% off Beats, Pixel Buds, and more

If you want a compact, no-frills smart TV that doesn't skimp on quality features, this 2-Series Fire TV is a good pick. You won't get 4K, but the 1080p HD still looks great, plus you get HDR10, HLG, and Dolby Digital Audio support alongside instant access to all of your favorite streaming services. The best part is that the Amazon's Memorial Day sale has dropped the price of the 40-inch smart TV to only $150. That's the cheapest that it's ever been!

If you're looking for more holiday discounts beyond the realm of Amazon, we've also been gathering all of the best deals from Best Buy's Memorial Day sale.
