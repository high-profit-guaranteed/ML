Lenovo’s Memorial Day sale is here, with up to 64% off laptop computers, desktops, gaming accessories, monitors and more. For a limited time, you can save an extra 15% off clearance items with promo code CLEARANCE2024. We spotted doorbuster deals from $12 on Lenovo.com.

But Lenovo’s website isn’t the only place to score a deal right now. From AirPods to big-screen TVs, Amazon has a number of tech deals happening, and one of the best offers is on Lenovo laptops, with new models on sale from just $199. That’s right, you can get a brand new Lenovo laptop computer for under $200.

Battery life is excellent, with up to 10 hours of usage on a single charge. And we like all the built-in features, like Dolby Audio speakers, a crystal clear webcam, and a ton of ports, including USB port, HDMI connection, 3.5mm headphone jack and an SD card reader.

This deal also includes a one-year subscription to Microsoft 365, which includes the full slate of Microsoft Office tools like Word, Excel and Powerpoint. In our experience, this is one of the best laptops for students or employees who are working from home; it’s great as a second “non-work” laptop too.

Get a new Lenovo IdeaPad Laptop for $199 here — the cheapest price since Cyber Monday. This is one of the best-reviewed Lenovo picks online with a 4.2-star rating (out of five) from dozens of verified reviews online.

This laptop also has a built-in 8MP camera with auto-focus, which is great for taking video calls. The folding design allows you to detach the keyboard or prop the screen up as a tablet. This deal comes with a Lenovo digital pen to make notes directly on screen too. Already a steal at its regular price of $429, you can save an additional 27% off right now on Lenovo.com.
