If you've been known to annotate every margin of your physical books but want the convenience of an e-reader, the Kindle Scribe is the answer. And during the Amazon Book Sale, you can find it for just $279.99, its lowest price ever. You'll save $110, scoring 29% off.

The Kindle Scribe has 32GB of storage and comes with its premium pen to get you writing. In addition to writing in your e-books, the Scribe includes a notebook feature for journaling. Plus, it converts handwritten notes to text and allows you to mark up PDFs too. The anti-glare screen is perfect for reading in the sun and the weeks of battery life means you can leave the charger at home while on vacation.

Of the Kindle family, the Paperwhite Signature is our favorite pick overall thanks to its features and reasonable price. While the Paperwhite Signature isn't on sale during the Amazon Book Sale, we still think it's worth the price if it fits your reading desires.
