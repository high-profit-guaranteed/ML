You've officially made it to the weekend. Celebrate with some impressive deals we found at Amazon on May 17, including all-time lows on fancy laptops, a high-tech smartwatch, a 40-inch Fire TV, and double-wall insulated water bottles to keep your water cold all summer long.

Here are our top picks for the best Amazon deals of the day. Be sure to check back at our deals from May 15 and May 16, as most of those deals are still going strong. Happy weekend!

A new record-low price on a new MacBook is cause for celebration. The 13-inch M3 MacBook Air, which was just released back in March, is on sale for just $949.99 at Amazon as of May 17 when you clip the on-page coupon. That's its biggest discount to date. The new Air features a zippy M3 chip that's reportedly 60 percent faster than the M1 chip from the 2020 Air models and 15 percent faster than the M2. But that's not its only upgrade; it also features WiFi 6E (a step up from last generation), supports up to two 5K, 60Hz external displays while closed, and comes in a brand-new midnight black shade. We reviewed its 15-inch sibling and were highly impressed, to say the least. "The 15-inch M3 MacBook Air continues to blur the line of the Air and Pro models, providing ample “oomph” for creatives, professionals, and students who need robust performance that can handle their multifaceted workflows," our reviewer wrote.

If you're not a Mac person, perhaps this deal on the Samsung Galaxy Book3 Pro will spark your interest. This particular model boasts a 14-inch 3K AMOLED display, a 13th gen Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, 512GB of storage, and an upgraded port assortment from its predecessor (two Thunderbolt 4 ports, USB type-A port, HDMI port, and microSD slot). An early 2023 release, it's no longer the latest and greatest in the Galaxy Book lineup (that honor would go to the Galaxy Book4 Pro), but it's still a powerful laptop that can handle everything from work to play. And at just $851.63 (reg. $1,449.99), it's quite the steal. That's 41% off its usual cost and a new all-time low.

A watch that caters to data-driven athletes and adventurers, the Garmin Fēnix 7X Pro Solar is back down to its all-time low Black Friday price at Amazon as of May 17. The 51mm version is down to $799.99, while the 47mm version is down to $699.99 — that's $200 in savings on either option. While we haven't reviewed the 7X Pro, we did try out its predecessor and found it to be quite the powerhouse. The new edition features a lighter case (one of our biggest pet peeves of the 6X Pro), better battery life, more accurate GPS, and even more in-depth data and apps. Plus, it packs an impressive solar-charging feature that extends battery life up to nine days (in smartwatch mode).

Up your hydration this summer with a Hydro Flask bottle that keeps your water ice cold for 24 hours. As of May 17, a ton of Hydro Flask bottles and accessories are on sale at Amazon. One of our top picks, however, is this stainless steel wide mouth water bottle, which fits 40 ounces of H2O in its leakproof, double-wall vacuum insulated container. It's usually $49.95, but it's on sale for just $26.57 — that's 47% in savings and its lowest price ever.

While it's not the fanciest TV in Amazon's lineup, the 2-Series has one thing that outshines the others: an insanely low price tag. The budget-friendly, no-frills smart TV may not support 4K resolution (you'll want to check out the 4-Series for that), but it still offers the basic smart capabilities of the Fire TV experience, hands-free control through on-board Alexa, and support for HDR 10, HLG, and Dolby Digital Audio. If you're looking to add HD entertainment to any room, it's going to be pretty hard to beat this price. Regularly only $249.99, you can grab the 40-inch 2-Series Fire TV for only $149.99 as of May 17 — that's 40% in savings and the lowest price to date.
