The weather is warming up, and so is Amazon's selection of deals. Whether you're looking for activewear to help you get outdoors, a new OLED TV or an upgrade for your smart home, you're in luck.

Right now the LG 65-inch B3 4K OLED TV is $1,196 at Amazon. This is $300 off, the lowest price I've seen for this model and an awesome deal for an OLED TV in this size. We rank it on our list of the best budget TVs, although note that the newer LG B4 OLED is now available.

Plus, the JBL Clip 4 is $49 at Amazon ($20 off.) This portable speaker is perfect for hikes, outdoor parties and more. It lasts for up to 10 hours of playback on a charge and is even waterproof.
