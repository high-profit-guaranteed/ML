Skechers shoes continue to be some of the most popular around. That's because this brand is well known for providing comfortable, supportive sneakers for everyday walks and PR-setting runs. If you're looking to snag yourself a pair, check out this Skechers sale at Amazon.

If you're looking to take up running, I highly recommend the Skechers Women's Go Run Lite Sneakers from $59 at Amazon. They're lightweight, breathable and have responsive Ultra Go cushioning. We rank them as the best Skechers for beginner runners.
