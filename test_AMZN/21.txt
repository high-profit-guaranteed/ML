Hot dogs on the grill, fruity cocktails in hand, Summer Fridays awaiting the corporate baddies, and of course, finally wearing white (if you follow that rule)… what’s that?! Memorial Day weekend, of course! The holiday weekend that unofficially kicks off the start of the summer always arrives with a slew of sales that you do NOT want to miss. Little-known fact: On top of your typical department store sales, beauty sales, and bedding sales, you can also head to your favorite everything site to find sales on… well… everything! Yuuuuppp, I’m talkin’ about Amazon!

But before we get into the deals, some important info…

Mark your calendars because Memorial Day 2024 is on May 27, 2024! Most sales will (at the very least) run throughout the entirety of Memorial Day weekend, which falls from May 25 to 27–including Amazon. In fact, they’ve already started releasing some early deals!

Okay, so what exactly are the best Amazon Memorial Day 2024 sales and deals?

While you’ll have to wait a bit longer for major discounts at a lot of stores (some haven’t even announced their sales yet), that isn’t the case for Amazon. The retailer has been rolling out some sneaky deals on the DL across fashion, beauty, home, and even tech—discounted AirPods, anyone?—that we’ve rounded up below for you to shop. I’m talkin’ 15%, 20%, even 40% off everything from wine glasses to full-length mirrors and Alix Earle’s TikTok-famous selfie light.

So, what are you waiting for?! Credit cards at the ready—it’s time to beat the crowds (aka the normies who didn’t get the Cosmo inside scoop, aka not you) and shop some of the best early Amazon Memorial Day 2024 sales ahead of the holiday wknd.
