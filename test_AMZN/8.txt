MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND is almost here, and a host of major sales are arriving with it. The unofficial summer kick-off is an excellent time to shop and save, whether you're looking for new fashion finds, running sneakers, or outdoor gear.

Allow us to introduce you to a secret savings section on a site you know and shop often: Amazon. The retailer has a hidden outlet section where you can save up to 69 percent off across categories.

We rounded up the best tech, home, outdoor gear, fashion, and footwear deals you can shop in advance of the long weekend. We're also giving you the lowdown on how to find the secret section, so you can continue to shop deals even after the holiday comes and goes. That said, overstock deals have a tendency to be short-lived, so you'll want to scoop these up quickly.

Finding the Amazon Outlet is not as complicated as you might think. If you're on a desktop, click the "All" button on the top left corner of the Amazon homepage. This will open up Amazon's different shopping sections. From there, scroll down and click "Programs & Features," then "See all" and you'll see "Amazon Outlet." Click here and you'll be taken to the Amazon Outlet homepage where you can shop via category, or search for specific products in the search bar.

If you're on the Amazon app, you can type "Amazon Outlet" into the search bar, and you'll be redirected to the outlet homepage.

Nope! You can shop Amazon Outlet deals even if you're not a Prime member. But, Prime members do get access to select deals on products outside of the outlet, fast and free shipping, plus some first chances to shop deals around major savings events, like Prime Day.
