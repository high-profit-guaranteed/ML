Amazon Music announced that Nate Smith would be the platform’s newest Breakthrough artist during the 59th Academy of Country Music Awards on Thursday night (May 16). Fellow Breakthrough alum Breland presented Smith with the honor.

Following the announcement, Smith and Avril Lavigne gave a performance of Smith’s single “Bulletproof.”

Amazon Music’s Breakthrough program aims to amplifying the best new talent and champion them at key moments early in their careers. As a part of this program, the platform will support Smith with a global marketing campaign, increased visibility across playlists and stations, an Amazon Music Original track and more.

“When it came time to select our next Breakthrough country artist, Nate Smith was the obvious choice. A generational voice and a true Nashville success story, it’s been a joy watching his rise and seeing country music fans discover his music over the last few years,” says Jenni Tay, artist relations for Amazon Music. “We’ve long championed his music, and with Nate joining the Breakthrough family, we’re excited to pull every lever and support Nate as he rises even further in country music and beyond.”

“Man, what a week it’s been and now this,” shares Smith. “I’m honestly so grateful to Amazon and the support they have always given me. Love getting to kick off this campaign with a performance with my friend Avril Lavigne. If this is just the start, I’m excited to see where it goes!”
