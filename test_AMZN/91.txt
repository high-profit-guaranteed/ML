The best smart home devices take your living space to the next level. You can add these gadgets to your home to upgrade its lighting aesthetic, reduce energy usage, as well as control appliances like your smart thermostat from anywhere. And since they integrate with the most popular smart home platforms you can schedule and automate them to respond to other connected devices.

Amazon is currently discounting smart home products from smart lights to smart plugs. These deals can help you build out your smart home to make it even more comfortable and convenient. My top pick is the $64 Amazon Echo (4th Gen). That 35% off is an insane value for what I find to be not only one of the best Alexa speakers, but also best smart home hubs since it doubles as one complete with Matter and Zigbee support. This smart speaker is a great place to start your smart home because beyond playing rich lossless music it can make calls, keep track of your day, and control all of your smart home devices.
