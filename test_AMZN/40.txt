Some of the best wireless headphones and wireless earbuds come from Beats. They're known for not only sounding good, but also being stylish. Naturally, such trendy audio gear comes with a high price tag, but Beats headphone deals come around periodically and make them more affordable. And with Memorial Day on the horizon, Amazon is taking as much as 49% off a huge variety of Beats products, including some of the latest models.

The biggest deal is on the latest Beats Studio Pro headphones. They are currently discounted by 49%, bringing the price down from $350 to $180. These are the best over-ear headphones Beats makes and an ideal pickup if you want active noise-cancellation. Don't need ANC? You can save $50 on the just-released Beats Solo 4 headphones, scoring them for $150. They are a solid upgrade over the previous-gen model, but our main gripe with them was the $200 list price. At $150, they are much easier to recommend. Or you can get the Beats Solo 3 instead for even less.

On the earbud side of things, you can save 20% on the Beats Fit Pro, bringing their price down from $200 to $160. They're the best earbuds for working out in with a secure fit and noise-cancellation, so it's a good opportunity to snag a set for less. Or the Beats Studio Buds are another solid choice and get you a set of noise-cancelling earbuds for just $80, a huge 47% discount. Even the Beats Flex neckband earbuds are down to just $39, which is 43% less than the regular price of $70.
