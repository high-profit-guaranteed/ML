Amazon said most of the front line jobs at the center will start at $17 an hour. Most employees will have access to benefits such as health care, dental and pre-paid tuition/job training, once they start working

Last year, during a media tour, Amazon officials said they projected the $200 million center would open by mid-2024. There had been talk about opening the operation is 2023, but those plans were delayed by supply chain issues.

The facility is being built on the site of the former Cortana Mall, at the intersection of Airline Highway and Florida Boulevard. Demolition of the mall started in March 2021.

The facility is nearly 90 feet tall, and the second through fifth floors are taken up by storage, robots and conveyors, which will pluck items and transport them down to the first floor for packaging and distribution. None of the items stored in the Cortana center will be sent directly to customers; instead the facility acts as the first cog in the distribution system Amazon has established.
