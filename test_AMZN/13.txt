The Modesto Fire Department rescued an Amazon delivery driver who fell into a 12-foot hole as he stepped out of his van in Oakdale on Thursday afternoon, according to an incident summary report.

The delivery driver was trapped for over an hour as fire department personnel attempted to pull him out. He was eventually removed and was transported to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

The incident occurred near the intersection of J Street and Cabernet Drive.

MFD spokesman Jim Black said the delivery driver did not fall all the way down the hole â€” a metal grate supported the man and prevented him from succumbing to the full depth of the drainage pipe.

It was unknown as of Friday if the grate was already down in the hole or if it fell when the delivery driver stepped on it. Regardless, the grate prevented further injuries to the man, said Black.

Oak Valley Ambulance, the Oakdale Police Department and Oakdale Public Works assisted in the rescue.
