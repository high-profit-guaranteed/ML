Marvel’s Silk: Spider Society is no longer happening at Amazon Prime Video. The series is now searching for a new streaming home.

Per The Hollywood Reporter, Amazon is no longer moving forward with the Sony Pictures Television-produced Silk: Spider Society series, which hailed from The Walking Dead’s Angela Kang.

The Silk: Spider Society news comes shortly after it was announced that Nicolas Cage will reprise his role as Spider-Man Noir in an upcoming Amazon Prime Video series, Noir, that does not yet have a release date.

According to Deadline, Kang’s latest Silk: Spider Society pitch was well received; however, “after deliberations where to allocate resources on genre IP projects — which are inherently pricey — a decision was made to proceed with Noir, starring Cage, and shelveSilk.”

“Kang, who departed her pact with AMC for what sources say is an eight-figure deal with Amazon, remains housed at the streamer and will continue to develop projects for the company,” The Hollywood Reporter’s article reads.

What else do we know about Silk: Spider Society?

Phil Lord, Christopher Miller, and Amy Pascal were also executive producers on the series, which was officially greenlit in November 2022.

Silk: Spider Society would have followed Cindy Moon, “a Korean-American woman bitten by the same spider that bit Peter Parker, as she escapes imprisonment and searches for her missing family on her way to becoming the superhero known as Silk,” according to the official logline.

“We can’t wait to bring the adventures of Cindy Moon to life, thanks to the creative dream team of Chris and Phil, Angela and Amy, along with our partners at Marvel and Amazon,” Sony Pictures Television Studios’ Katherine Pope said when the series was ordered by the streaming service. “We know this exciting series with new and never-before-seen characters and storylines will wow audiences watching first on linear MGM+ and then around the world on Prime Video.”
