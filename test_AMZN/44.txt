Memorial Day isn’t until next week, but Amazon isn’t waiting to start discounting some of its best-selling items ahead of the holiday weekend. The retailer's latest weekend sale has arrived and includes deals on some of the best PS5 games.

My favorite discounts include the extremely underrated Marvel's Midnight Suns for just $19. This epic game combines awesome combat with a surprisingly deep relationship-building mechanic. There's also Assassin's Creed Mirage for $29, the stunning Dead Space Remake for $38 and Elden Ring for $48. Yes, we've seen the open-world wonder drop lower in the past but now is a great time to play as its long-awaited DLC expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree, releases next month.

If you're looking for something new to play on your PS5 this weekend, you're spoilt for choice. Here are the 15 deals in Amazon's current sale that I'd recommend...
• Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Extraction: was $39 now $11
• No Man's Sky: was $59 now $25
• Prince of Persia The Lost Crown: was $49 now $29
• Skull and Bones: was $69 now $55
