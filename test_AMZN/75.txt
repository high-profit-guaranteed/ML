Outfitting your PS5 with a larger NVMe SSD for more storage space is a worthwhile upgrade. Unfortunately, NVMe SSD prices are higher than they were last year due to production costs and general shortages, so it isn't always easy to justify the expense. Unless, of course, you're lucky enough to find one on sale--and that's what we're here to help with. We've waded through the Amazon listings to find the best discounts on NVMe SSDs that are compatible with PlayStation 5.

All of the internal NVMe SSDs listed here are also compatible with PC and most come with a heatsink preinstalled. Installing an NVMe SSD in your PS5's open M.2 slot is a pretty simple process, but we have a step-by-step guide in case you need assistance. Bear in mind that while these deals will save you some cash on these internal SSDs, due to the aforementioned shortages, it's uncommon in 2024 (so far) to find a well-regarded PS5-compatible 1TB SSD for less than around $90.

If you're specifically in the market for an NVMe SSD for your PC, you can get slightly better deals--mainly because the PS5 is limited to SSDs with fairly high sequential read speed requirements. But it never hurts to future-proof your PC either, so the deals below are certainly worth considering even if you don't own a PS5. Let's take a look at the best PS5 SSD deals at Amazon right now.
