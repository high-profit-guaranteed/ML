Amazon is so sure of its upcoming Aldis Hodge led original series, “Cross,” that the media giant has opted to renew the show for a second season ahead of the show even hitting the airwaves.

Based on renowned author James Patterson’s popular Alex Cross book series, the Prime Video series will star Hodge as Cross, a smarter than most detective with a knack for using his psychological skills to get into the mind of the criminals he routinely foils.

“Bringing one of James Patterson’s most iconic literary characters to life for our global Prime Video

 customers was a dream come true, and we can’t wait for everyone to see Aldis Hodge’s dynamic

 performance as Cross,” said Vernon Sanders, head of television at Amazon MGM Studios.

“Ben Watkins and his team have created something unique within the crime-thriller genre that long-time fans and newcomers alike will all enjoy,” he continued. “And with over 30 novels written by Patterson featuring Alex Cross as his main protagonist, it was an easy choice to bring ‘Cross’ back for a second season.

With Watkins acting as showrunner and sharing executive producer duties with Hodge and others, the project also features a talented ensemble cast, including Alona Tal, Caleb Elijah, Isaiah Mustafa, Juanita Jennings, Melody Hurd, Samantha Walkes and Ryan Eggold. Season two will also add new regular cast members Jeanine Mason, Johnny Ray Gill, Matthew Lillard and Wes Chatham.

“Cross” is scheduled to debut on Prime Video in the fall.
