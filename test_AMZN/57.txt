EA Sports College Football 25 preorders are popping up at major retailers ahead of its July 19 release. You can preorder physical copies of EA Sports College Football 25 for $70 at Amazon, Best Buy, and GameStop. A couple of digital-only editions are available on the PlayStation Store and Xbox Store. Ordering any version early will net you some neat in-game bonuses.

Football fans have been starving for a new college football sim since NCAA Football 14 released back in 2013. Over a decade later, dinner will soon be served. Unlike Madden NFL 25, EA's new college football game will not be available on last-gen PlayStation and Xbox consoles. Nor will you be able to play it on PC. To return to the collegiate gridiron, you'll need to own either a PS5 or Xbox Series X|S.

If you need a PS5, Walmart has the Marvel's Spider-Man 2 PS5 Slim bundle in stock for $449 (valued at $560). Alternatively, you can buy an Xbox Series X bundled with Diablo 4 for $470 at Walmart.

You also get the Cover Athlete Ultimate Team Pack and Bring Glory Home Ultimate Team Uniform Item. At Best Buy, you'll get a free $5 gift card with your preorder of EA Sports College Football 25.
