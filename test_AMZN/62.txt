Prime Video’s German series Maxton Hall – The World Between Us has been handed a swift recommission after becoming the streamer’s most-watched international show of all time in its first week.

The YA series about a British boarding school from UFA Fiction “achieved the largest first week global viewership for an International Original in Prime Video history,” the streamer said today upon the Season 2 greenlight. Amazon said Maxton Hall has occupied the number one spot of the Prime Video Charts in more than 120 countries and territories and is top three in more than 50 countries including the U.S., UK, Mexico, Brazil, Australia, Canada and South Africa.

Based on Mona Kasten’s Save You and starring Damian Hardung and Harriet Herbig-Matten, the series follows Ruby, who unwittingly witnesses an explosive secret at Maxton Hall private school. The arrogant millionaire heir James Beaufort then has to deal with the quick-witted scholarship student for better or worse. From that point on, the handsome student tries to buy Ruby’s silence and they soon risk everything to be together.

James Farrell, Amazon MGM Studio’s VP of International Originals, said the show “once again proves that local stories have the power to captivate global audiences,” following the success of the likes of France’s Medellín, and Spain’s Culpa Mía and Reina Roja.

UFA producer Ceylan Yildirim added: “While we started off as a local production for the German market, Prime Video first built enthusiasm for our project internally and then shared it with the world. We are overwhelmed by the euphoric reactions.”
