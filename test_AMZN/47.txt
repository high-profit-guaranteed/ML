Who among us doesn’t have a love-hate relationship with mirrors? Sad but true! One thing that has made me considerably more fond of them as of late is my discovery of the best mirrors on Amazon. As someone who can only tolerate being photographed in a mirror—god forbid a full frontal shot—I know that this is a deceptively crucial part of all good home décor. Your space depends on the right pieces, as do your selfies.

In the process of scouring Amazon’s home offerings, I did some, ahem, reflecting on just how much design power they have. A mirror can make a space appear more open and bright, which goes a long way for apartment dwellers. It can complete an entryway or elevate a tiny closet. Perhaps most importantly, a mirror can save you from leaving the house with lipstick on your teeth, and that’s priceless. So, go ahead and tack these onto that ever-growing list of things to add to your Amazon cart, along with couches, towels, and my favorite leggings. Here, find 15 of the best mirrors to shop now.
