Rising global demand for automobiles and economic growth in emerging markets are primary drivers for the auto manufacturing industry. Therefore, while quality auto stock Stellantis N.V. (STLA) could be a solid buy, Ford Motor Company (F) could be best kept on hold. However, Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) could be best avoided.

Anticipated enhancements in inventory management and strong consumer demand are poised to propel global auto sales to an estimated 86.80 million units in 2023, surpassing earlier forecasts. This upward trajectory is forecasted to persist in 2024, with sales projected to reach 90.20 million units, primarily credited to the improved performance of the supply chain. Notably, U.S. motor vehicle production is projected to reach approximately 11.7 million units by 2025.

Additionally, the worldwide automotive market is projected to reach $6.07 trillion by 2030, growing at a 6.9% CAGR. This growth is attributable to increasing customer interest in electric vehicles (EVs) and advancements in autonomous driving technology.

With advancements in battery technology, improved charging infrastructure, and an ever-expanding range of electric vehicle models, the automotive industry is gearing up to meet the evolving preferences of consumers and address the global imperative for reduced carbon emissions.

Moreover, rising fuel prices drive heightened consumer interest in electric vehicles (EVs). Last year, the U.S. electric vehicle (EV) market set a new record in 2022 with nearly 918,500 light EV sales, surpassing 2018 by over two and a half times.

Looking ahead, the U.S. electric vehicle market is projected to reach $137.43 billion in 2028, expanding at a CAGR of 25.4%.

However, economic uncertainties and fluctuations in global markets can impact consumer confidence and purchasing power. Also, the auto industry is highly competitive, with new entrants, both traditional and from other sectors, continually emerging. Intense competition can pressure profit margins and necessitate constant innovation and differentiation.
