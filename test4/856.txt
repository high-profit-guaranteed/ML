A Tesla Inc TSLA owner was driving his Model Y down the road when the car began shaking. A few minutes after he pulled over to check for a flat tire, the whole car burst into flames.

The only advice Tesla's customer service team offered was to bring the burnt vehicle to their service center.

What Happened: After Bishal Malla's Tesla went up in smoke on the side of the road, he called Tesla looking for help. Instead of answers, he was met with ridiculous requests, per a Business Insider report.

Although the company made note of the report, no one offered any real guidance. He followed up with the company several times, but again received much of the same.

"One agent I talked to had an audacity to tell me to take my fully burned Tesla to the Tesla recommended servicing center," Malla wrote in a post on Reddit.

"How in the world am I going to do that?"

The Tesla owner reportedly told Business Insider that the customer service representative didn't even recommend a way of transporting the burned vehicle.

He acknowledged on Reddit that the incident would be covered by insurance, but Malla was more concerned about his safety and the safety of others.

He still hasn't been able to get answers from the EV maker, which is surprising, he said, adding he was shocked when he pulled over to find the car on fire and noted that he felt lucky to be alive.

"If this had happened 30 minutes later, my whole family would be in there," Malla said.
