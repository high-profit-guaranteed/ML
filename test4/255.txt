The clouds are finally parting for Tesla Inc. investors who stuck with the electric-vehicle maker through a rough ride. A rush of good news for the company and the return of bullish market conviction have put the stock on pace to more than double this year.

The Elon Musk -led EV company has added more than $194 billion to its market valuation in an 11-day run, as the shares tied with their longest-ever winning streak. It is only the second time in Teslaâ€™s history that the shares have managed this feat.
