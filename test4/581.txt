Tesla Inc.’s China deliveries slumped in July to the lowest level this year, as the electric vehicle maker struggles to attract buyers despite price cuts and other incentives.

The company’s Shanghai plant delivered 64,285 cars last month, a 31.4% drop from June, according to preliminary data published by China’s Passenger Car Association on Thursday. The PCA doesn’t break down numbers for local deliveries versus exports, but Tesla typically focuses on shipping overseas in the beginning of each quarter.
