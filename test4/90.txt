Tesla Inc. shares extended their brutal selloff, pulling the companyâ€™s market valuation below the key half-trillion dollar mark as investors increasingly fear its price-cutting plan will eat into profits.

The stock price closed down 4.3% at $153.75, the lowest since Jan. 25. The company has lost more than $84 billion from its market capitalization over five trading sessions since posting disappointing earnings . The shares are down more than 26% in April alone.
