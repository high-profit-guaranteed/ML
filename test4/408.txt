The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.

If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Tesla with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.

Tesla has undergone a massive growth in earnings per share over the last three years. So much so that this three year growth rate wouldn't be a fair assessment of the company's future. So it would be better to isolate the growth rate over the last year for our analysis. Tesla's EPS skyrocketed from US$2.79 to US$3.72, in just one year; a result that's bound to bring a smile to shareholders. That's a fantastic gain of 33%.

It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Tesla maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 38% to US$86b. That's a real positive.

Fortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Tesla's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.

Are Tesla Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?

Since Tesla has a market capitalisation of US$895b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$130b. Coming in at 14% of the business, that holding gives insiders a lot of influence, and plenty of reason to generate value for shareholders. Very encouraging.

Should You Add Tesla To Your Watchlist?

For growth investors, Tesla's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares. The growth and insider confidence is looked upon well and so it's worthwhile to investigate further with a view to discern the stock's true value. It is worth noting though that we have found 1 warning sign for Tesla that you need to take into consideration.
