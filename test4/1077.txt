Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Tesla (TSLA) are all warning there may be tough times ahead for the U.S. electric vehicle market. It come after more than 313,000 EV's were sold in the U.S. in the third quarter, a new record, according to data from Cox Automotive. Yahoo Finance Senior Autos Reporter Pras Subramanian explains why this may be a tipping point for U.S. EV sales.

JULIE HYMAN: And of course, as we talk about the transition to clean energy, one theme for automakers this earnings season is weakness in electric vehicles. Yahoo Finance senior autos reporter Pras Subramanian here with the details. And, you know, it's quite interesting that we have not been hearing a lot of super optimistic commentary about EV demand.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, you know, it's funny. Just only a few months ago, we saw-- or even just in Q3, we saw EV sales hitting a tipping point here, nearing 8%, according to KBB, a record 300,000 EVs sold in Q3. But now, cut to a few weeks later, Ford, GM, even Tesla, all warning about how the EV market is sort of slowing down, each with its own sort of concerns.

With Ford, they're pushing back around $12 billion in EV investments, saying that buyers are unwilling to pay a premium for EVs over gas-powered cars. GM sort of echoing similar complaints or concerns, talking about slower near-term demand for growth, having them pause investments. And like I said, even Elon Musk saying that higher rates here, higher finance costs. He says we need to make the cars cheaper in order for people to buy them. And maybe perhaps right now, they're not.

So you know, what's sort of happening is that early adopters and people like that have already spoken for, and high prices are kind of keeping middle class buyers, the lion's share of buyers away from EVs at this point. Some would say even politics are getting in the way. But I think bottom line, though, Julie, is, I don't think the EV transformation is going away. It's just going to take longer than people thought in this current environment. The cars are better for the environment, better CO2 emissions-- obviously none. Easier to maintain, offer better performance, but we're just not seeing that full transformation just yet. It's just going to take more time to get there.

JOSH LIPTON: Pras, thank you so much for that. Have a great weekend.
