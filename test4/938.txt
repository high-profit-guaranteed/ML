1. After reporting record deliveries for the first two quarters of 2023, Tesla witnessed a sequential fall in its deliveries for the September quarter. The EV king delivered 435,059 (15,985 Model S/X and 419,074 Model 3/Y) vehicles worldwide in the third quarter. While that’s a 26.5% increase from the year-ago levels, it marks a 6.6% sequential decline from 446,140 vehicles delivered in the second quarter of 2022.

Tesla produced 430,488 (416,800 Model 3/Y, and 13,688 Model S/X) vehicles during the quarter, up 17.6% on a yearly basis but down from 479,700 units produced in the second quarter of 2023. The sequential decline in production and delivery volumes was due to planned factory shutdowns for an upgrade, as already notified by the company on its second-quarter 2023 earnings call.

The automaker produced 16,304 units, representing an uptick of 121% from the year-ago quarter. The company manufactured all its vehicles in Normal, IL, factory. It delivered 15,564 units, up 136% from the corresponding quarter of 2022. Deliveries rose 23% sequentially and surpassed Wall Street estimates.

The company is on track to manufacture 52,000 vehicles this year, consistent with its previous guidance. Rivian currently produces the R1T truck, the R1S SUV and a series of electric delivery vans for Amazon. Rivian plans to expand its lineup with additional powertrain and battery versions of its existing consumer vehicles.

In a recent securities filing, Rivian proposed to offer $1.5 billion in green convertible senior notes due by Oct 15, 2030, to eligible institutional investors. Interested buyers would also have the option to buy up to $255 million in principal notes, with settlement available within 12 days from the issuance date.

5. Li Auto delivered 36,060 vehicles in September 2023, up 212.7% year over year and 3.3% month over month. The company delivered 105,108 vehicles in the third quarter of 2023, up 296.3% year over year. As of Sep 30, 2023, Li Auto’s cumulative deliveries reached 244,225.
