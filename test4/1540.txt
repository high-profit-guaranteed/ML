Here's our daily look at three charts tied to recent news-driven price moves, with key technical levels to watch.

Alphabet (GOOGL) may come under increased scrutiny Friday after Reuters reported that Google has agreed to settle a $5 billion consumer privacy lawsuit which alleged the search engine and cloud computing giant secretly tracked users' online activity while in private mode.

Although settlement details were not disclosed, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers put a hold on the proposed class action trial after lawyers for both parties agreed to a preliminary settlement. According to the report, a formal settlement for court approval is expected by Feb. 24.

GOOGL shares broke above a diamond top chart pattern in mid-December but have mostly traded sideways over the past week. If the price retracts in upcoming trading sessions, closely monitor the $135 area where it may encounter support from the pattern’s right upper trendline and the 50-day moving average. It's also worth watching the stock’s all-time high around $150 which may act as a key resistance area should the price continue to climb.

Tesla’s (TSLA) December stock rally hit the skids on the penultimate trading day of the year after Chinese consumer electronic company Xiaomi Corporation (XIACY) unveiled plans to enter China’s saturated EV market.

Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun said during a recent presentation that the company’s car model, the Xiaomi SU7, surpasses Tesla’s popular Model S on acceleration and other key metrics. Xiaomi has spent 10 billion Chinese yuan ($1.4 billion) to develop the SU7 over three years and expects it to roll off the production line in early 2024. No price tag for the vehicle has been finalized.

According to data from the China Passenger Car Association, Tesla's Sino-made EV sales fell 17.8% in November from the same month a year earlier, highlighting increased competition in China’s EV market.

Since breaking out from a symmetrical triangle earlier this month, the TSLA share price has failed to gain traction. Moreover, share volumes have decreased over the past two weeks, though this may be more related to slower end-of-year trading activity. Looking ahead, It’s worth keeping an eye on the $240 level—an area on the chart that may find support from the triangle pattern’s top trendline and the 50- and 200-day moving averages.

Shares in Altice (ATUS) jumped more than 6% Thursday after the company announced that it has sold its financial news streaming service Cheddar News to media firm Archetype.

Terms of the deal were not made public. However, a source familiar with the negotiations told CNBC that the transaction was structured as a close-out deal where Altice USA will potentially collect payments of up to $50 million, providing Chedder reaches certain performance targets. Chedder News, which targets a millennial audience, was founded in 2016 and purchased by Altice USA in 2019 for $200 million.

Although ATUS shares have spent the lion’s share of 2023 tracking sideways to lower, recent price action indicates a distinct change in investor sentiment. In mid-December, the stock broke above a multi-month downtrend line on above-average volume and has since continued to trend higher. If the price climbs from these levels, keep an eye on a zone of resistance between $5.25 and $6.85. On the other hand, if the stock retraces, monitor the $2.50 level on the chart which may find support from the 50-day moving average.
