Tesla Inc. shares jumped to a seven-month high Wednesday, riding on the insatiable investor appetite for mega-cap tech stocks and a string of recent positive news.

The electric-vehicle maker’s stock closed up 1.5% to $224.57 in New York, marking its ninth straight day of gains and the longest winning streak since January 2021. Tesla shares are up 82% this year despite some recent declines, as they rebound from last year’s 65% plunge.
