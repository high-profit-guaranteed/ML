• None Significantly high institutional ownership implies Tesla's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions
• None A total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 44% ownership

If you want to know who really controls Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 43% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).

And institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 3.5% last week. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 5.6% for shareholders. Also referred to as "smart money", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Tesla, which might have negative implications on individual investors.

In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Tesla.

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Tesla?

Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.

Tesla already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Tesla, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.

Hedge funds don't have many shares in Tesla. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is the CEO Elon Musk with 13% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.0% and 5.9%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.

A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.

While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.

The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.

Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
