The US auto sales are expected to remain strong, with increased demand and the introduction of new electric vehicles expected to drive sales even higher. However, as macroeconomic uncertainties remain, I think it would be wise to wait for a better entry point in General Motors Company (GM). In addition, Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) is best avoided, considering its weak fundamentals.

Before delving deeper into the fundamentals of these stocks, let’s discuss what’s happening in the auto industry.

The auto industry’s growth is fueled by increased demand for electric vehicles (EVs), environmental awareness, and government incentives, which contribute to the industry’s sustainability. The revenue from the U.S. EV market is expected to reach $82.80 billion by 2024, with a significant CAGR of 18.2% until 2028.

However, the auto industry is expected to experience slower growth this year due to increased interest rates, high prices for new cars and light trucks, rising raw material costs, and supply chain disruptions, impacting consumer purchasing power.

Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds, said, “There’s definitely pent-up demand out there, because people have been holding off purchases for a while. But given the credit situation, we don’t think the industry will see a ton of growth this year.”

While increased demand and new electric vehicles are positive factors for US auto sales, it is important to consider the potential impact of macroeconomic uncertainties on the industry. Therefore, waiting for a better entry point at GM can help mitigate some of the risks associated with these uncertainties. Additionally, TSLA should be avoided due to its weak fundamentals, which may further expose investors to potential downside risks.
