NOLENSVILLE – Tom Pettit is used to helping pick up trash and doing other tasks this weekend as the high school lacrosse coach at the host field during the Tennessee Scholastic Lacrosse Association's boys state tournament.

However on Friday, Pettit and his lacrosse team had a new perspective. Trash pick up had to wait as Nolensville played in its first TSLA Class A state championship game and beat Signal Mountain 11-5.

Nolensville (11-3) was up 9-2 at halftime and never looked back after building a 5-1 lead early in the second quarter.

"We've had to work and clean up trash while these other programs were playing," Pettit said. "And it's hard. This year we really wanted it — finally. We got to reap all the benefits of having all our fans here."

Nolensville's student section rushed the field with a couple seconds left, then forced to go back to the sidelines and then rush it again moments later. The Knights tossed their lacrosse sticks into the air, celebrating with each other before turning to their classmates and parents.

Not only was it a historic win, but it came with two sophomores leading the team in the title game. Jake Manning and Hadyn Gross scored three goals apiece for the Knights.

Gross, who finished with 29 goals for the season, received the team's championship belt — something that is passed to a different player each week.

"The belt is something our coaches made," Gross said. "Every single time a player out performs everyone else or plays really, really well and we win this is given to them. The person that is given it last game gives it to the next player.

"I was kind of disappointed I didn't win it all year. To get it in the state championship and then get our medals just feel amazing."
