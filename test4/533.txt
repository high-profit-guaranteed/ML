Benzinga examined the prospects for many investors' favorite stocks over the last week â€” here's a look at some of our top stories.

The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) ended the week on a positive note, with gains of 0.69% and 2.08% respectively, marking the second consecutive week of gains. The DJIA also recorded its 10th straight positive session on Friday, its longest winning streak since August 2017.

However, the Nasdaq fell by 0.57% over the week, and the market saw increased volatility due to the expiration of about $2.3 trillion in derivative option contracts. Looking ahead, traders are cautious due to the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee Meeting, with expectations of a 0.25% rate hike already factored in, but uncertainty remains about the Fed's future plans.
