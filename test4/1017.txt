Check out the full TSLA Q3 2023 earnings report on the Tesla Investor Relations website.
• $3.0B increase in our cash and investments QoQ to $26.1B

Our main objectives remained unchanged in Q3-2023: reducing cost per vehicle, free cash flow generation while maximizing delivery volumes and continued investment in AI and other growth projects.

Our cost of goods sold per vehicle4 decreased to ~$37,500 in Q3. While production cost at our new factories remained higher than our established factories, we have implemented necessary upgrades in Q3 to enable further unit cost reductions. We continue to believe that an industry leader needs to be a cost leader.

During a high interest rate environment, we believe focusing on investments in R&D and capital expenditures for future growth, while

maintaining positive free cash flow, is the right approach. Year-to-date, our free cash flow reached $2.3B while our cash and investments position continues to improve.

We have more than doubled the size of our AI training compute to accommodate for our growing dataset as well as our Optimus robot

project. Our humanoid robot is currently being trained for simple tasks through AI rather than hard-coded software, and its hardware is being further upgraded.

Lastly, with a combined gross profit generation of over $0.5B in Q3, our Energy Generation and Storage business and Services and Other business have become meaningful contributors to our profitability.

Total revenue grew 9% YoY in Q3 to $23.4B. YoY, revenue was impacted by the following items:
• + growth in other parts of the business

Our operating income decreased YoY to $1.8B in Q3, resulting in a 7.6% operating margin. YoY, operating income was

primarily impacted by the following items:
• - increase in operating expenses driven by Cybertruck, AI and other R&D projects
• - cost of production ramp and idle cost related to factory upgrades
• + growth in vehicle deliveries (despite the margin headwind from underutilization from new factories)
• + gross profit growth in Energy Generation and Storage as well as Services and Other

Quarter-end cash, cash equivalents and investments increased sequentially by $3.0B to $26.1B in Q3, driven by financing

activities of $2.3B and free cash flow of $0.8B.
• We are planning to grow production as quickly as possible in alignment with the 50% CAGR target we began guiding to in early 2021. In some years we may grow faster and some we may grow slower, depending on a number of factors. For 2023, we expect to remain ahead of the long-term 50% CAGR with around 1.8 million vehicles for the year.
• We have ample liquidity to fund our product roadmap, long-term capacity expansion plans and other expenses.

Furthermore, we will manage the business such that we maintain a strong balance sheet during this uncertain period.
• While we continue to execute on innovations to reduce the cost of manufacturing and operations, over time, we expect our hardware-related profits to be accompanied by an acceleration of AI, software and fleet-based profits.
• Cybertruck deliveries remain on track for later this year. In addition, we continue to make progress on our next generation platform.
