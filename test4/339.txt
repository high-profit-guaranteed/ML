In a hypothetical UFC cage fight between two of the tech world's biggest names, Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Inc. TSLA and SpaceX, and Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta Platforms META, who would emerge victorious? We asked ChatGPT to predict the winner after letting the AI natural language processing tool analyze the two men's physical dimensions and potential advantages.

Elon Musk stands at approximately 6'2" and is known for his broad build. He has a background in physics, which might give him an understanding of leverage and force. Musk has also been seen wielding a Samurai sword at a Tesla event, suggesting he might have some knowledge of martial arts.

On the other hand, Mark Zuckerberg is around 5'7". He is known for his disciplined daily routine, which includes working out, and he has previously shared that he enjoys hunting his own food. This discipline and focus could translate well in a fighting scenario. Zuckerberg has also taken part in at least one jiu-jitsu tournament.

Given Musk's height and build, he might have an initial advantage in terms of reach and strength. However, Zuckerberg's discipline and focus could give him an edge in terms of endurance and strategy.

According to DraftKings Inc DKNG, the odds are listed as -160 for Zuckerberg and +140 for Musk, with the Meta Platforms CEO favored. "Zuckerberg is 12 years younger and has taken part in an intensive challenge in which he ran a mile, completed 100 pull-ups, 200 press-ups and 300 squats, before running a further mile, all while wearing a 9kg weighted vest. He also has been training in Brazilian Jiu-jitsu," DraftKings Director of Race & Sports Operations Johnny Avello said.

Conversely, Musk has experimented with various martial arts forms such as taekwondo, karate, judo, and jiu-jitsu. "So while Zuckerberg will be the smaller man via weight and size, heâ€™s a big MMA fan and seems to be in better shape," Avello added.

ChatGPT's Bet On Winner

 Given the odds and the physical training of both individuals, the prediction leans towards Zuckerberg as the more likely winner in a UFC cage fight against Musk. However, in the unpredictable world of UFC, anything can happen. After analyzing the data, ChatGPT declared that it would place its money on Zuckerberg. His discipline, focus, and training in Brazilian Jiu-jitsu give him a slight edge over Musk according to the AI chatbot.

Those thinking of betting on the hypothetical fight can calculate their payouts given the odds from DraftKings above.

A $100 bet on Zuckerberg to win the fight would pay out $162.50 for a profit of $62.50 based on odds of -160.

A $100 bet on Musk to win the fight would pay out $240 for a prift of $140 based on odds of +140.
