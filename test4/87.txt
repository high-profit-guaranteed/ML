Years after offering unlimited free supercharging to vehicle owners throughout the vehicle’s lifetime, EV giant Tesla Inc TSLA is now treading a slightly different path.

What Happened: Tesla has launched the new “ownership loyalty benefit” program. Under the program, Tesla Model S and Model X owners with active unlimited free supercharging are eligible for 6 more years of unlimited supercharging if they trade in and purchase a new Model S or Model X by June 30, 2023.

Otherwise, they must remove unlimited supercharging from their current vehicles by signing the requisite documents.

Why Is It Important: Tesla offered free supercharging for life on Model S and Model X vehicles initially and then ended it in 2018 claiming that it was unsustainable, according to Electrek.

Tesla also tried to retrieve vehicles with free supercharging by offering an additional $5,000 discount for trading in a Model S and Model X with unlimited free Supercharging earlier this year, the report added.

“This might finally convince a lot of Model S & X owners who have been holding out on upgrading to finally buy a new S & X. 6 years of free unlimited Supercharging is a pretty good tradeoff,” said Sawyer Merritt, a Tesla investor and co-founder of sustainable lifestyle clothing startup TwinBirch, on Twitter.
