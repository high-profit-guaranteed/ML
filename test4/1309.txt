Tesla (TSLA) shares close a hair lower on Friday, a full day after its launch event for the long-awaited Cybertruck which has garnered mixed reactions from analysts and potential buyers.

The lower-end model will be on sale for $61,000 while the higher-end “Cyberbeast” vehicle will go for nearly $100,000, before taking into account EV tax rebates and savings on fuel costs for American car buyers.

Ronald Jewsikow, Guggenheim Securities Vice President of Automotive Equity Research, joins Yahoo Finance Live to weigh in on the possible market for the Cybertruck's model tiers and what widespread possibilities exist for the electric truck.

Jewsikow states that there will be a "much smaller market" due to the cost and design of the truck, predicting that it will most primarily attract "enthusiasts." Jewsikow does not expect this to "move the needle" for Tesla, but does note the possibility of widespread adoption of certain technology and features found in the Cybertruck.

DIANE KING HALL: Tesla's long awaited Cybertruck has finally arrived. And the first buyers are getting the keys after two years of production delays.

ELON MUSK: so we're just-- these are the actual owners. We're handing over production Cybertrucks to their actual owners. Thank you for buying Cybertruck.

DIANE KING HALL: There are two models of the trucks. And they'll set you back between $60,000 and $100,000. $100,000 mark is that's for the Cyberbeast.

JOSH LIPTON: I love that name. Love it.

DIANE KING HALL: OK. So I will give some credit there, because, you know, I was in the camp where I was like, this is too much, this is ridiculous. But so we have a note also from Dan Ives already out on with initial thoughts on the Cybertruck launch, saying that the pricing was in line with expectations.

I was a little surprised, though, that the low end was not a little bit lower. I will say that.

JOSH LIPTON: Yeah. I think what analysts-- listen, the analysts are already crunching the numbers. And I think what they've concluded it's not going to financially move the needle at least in the near term. I do think it's interesting, though, this idea of a halo effect. That does it help reinvigorate a brand that some say had lost some shine because of the lack of new models.

DIANE KING HALL: Well, we will certainly watch and see what the demand is like for the Cybertruck.
