Tesla Inc TSLA CEO Elon Musk is seemingly concerned after CNBC Mad Money host and former hedge fund manager Jim Cramer termed the EV giant one of the greatest investments of all time together with Netflix Inc NFLX.

What Happened: Cramer termed the two stocks to be the greatest investment of all time and said that he got nothing and heard nothing at all on Wednesday night after the companies reported their second-quarter earnings which made him feel differently about them.

“Uh oh,” Musk wrote in response to the comment on Twitter.

Why It Matters: Social media has often joked that a recommendation of stock by Cramer is a death kiss and vice versa. In fact, his recommendations are even the theme of an ETF that tracks his stock picks.

In October, Matthew Tuttle‘s Tuttle Capital Management filed two new ETFs- the Inverse Cramer ETF and the Long Cramer ETF. While the Inverse Cramer ETF bets against Cramer’s stock recommendations, Long Cramer ETF will invest in stocks and ETFs on which Cramer is positive.

Both Tesla and Netflix stocks closed down on Thursday with Tesla shares tumbling 9.7% and Netflix down 8.4%.

Tesla stock dipped after the earnings call as the team failed to provide a clear timeline for the delivery of its upcoming Cybertruck. Tesla also warned that production will slow down in the third quarter as factories shut down to make way for improvements.
