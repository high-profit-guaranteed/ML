Tesla Inc TSLA CEO Elon Musk said on Wednesday that he would explore a potential partnership between his electric vehicle (EV) company and his artificial intelligence startup, xAI, following suggestions from investors on X.

What Happened: Dave Lee, a Tesla investor since 2012, initiated the idea on X, proposing a collaboration where Tesla would make financial investments and contribute DOJO compute resources to xAI. In return, xAI would provide equity and access to its AI chatbot, Grok AI, to Tesla.

Several investors supported the concept, emphasizing the interest of many Tesla retail investors in playing a role in xAI.

“Will discuss with Tesla Board,” Musk wrote in response, much to the excitement of shareholders.

Why It Matters: Collaboration between Musk’s various companies is not unprecedented. Previously, Musk considered integrating Neuralink with a Tesla bot to develop bionic limbs for amputees.

Additionally, Musk’s Boring Company implemented “underground loops” using mostly Tesla cars to address traffic concerns. Furthermore, a Tesla Cybertruck was also recently seen hauling a SpaceX Starship Raptor engine.
