Tesla is out with the company's Q4 2023 earnings results, and the stock is reacting to the news in after-hours trading. The electric vehicle company reported adjusted earnings-per-share (EPS) of $0.71/share and revenues of $25.2 billion. Earnings missed the EPS whisper number of $0.77/share and analyst estimates of $0.74/share. Revenues also missed Wall Street analyst estimates of $25.6 billion.

Check out the full TSLA Q4 2023 earnings report on the Tesla Investor Relations website.
• One-time non-cash tax benefit of $5.9B recorded in Q4 for the release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets
• Operating cash flow of $13.3B; free cash flow of $4.4B in 2023
• Operating cash flow of $4.4B; free cash flow of $2.1B in Q4
• $3.0B increase in our cash and investments in Q4 to $29.1B
• Operations Model Y became the best-selling vehicle in the world

In 2023, we delivered over 1.2 million Model Ys, making it the best-selling vehicle, of any kind, globally. For a long time, many doubted the viability of EVs. Today, the best-selling vehicle on the planet is an EV.

Free cash flow remained strong in 2023 at $4.4B, even as we focused on future growth projects with our highest capital expenditures and R&D expenses in company history.

Energy storage deployments reached 14.7 GWh in 2023, more than double compared to the previous year, while Energy Generation and Storage business profits nearly quadrupled in 2023. Gross profit of our Services & Other business increased from a ~$500M loss in 2019 to a ~$500M profit in 2023.

Cost of goods sold per vehicle declined sequentially in Q4. Our team remains focused on growing our output, investing in our future growth and finding additional cost efficiencies in 2024.

In late December, we started rolling out V12 of FSD Beta. Trained on data from a fleet of over a million vehicles, this system uses AI to influence vehicle controls (steering wheel, pedals, indicators, etc.) instead of hard-coding every driving behavior. V12 marks a new era in the path to full autonomy.

We are focused on bringing the next generation platform to market as quickly as we can, with the plan to start production at Gigafactory Texas. This platform will revolutionize how vehicles are manufactured.

Revenue Total revenue grew 3% YoY in Q4 to $25.2B. YoY, revenue was impacted by the following items:
• growth in other parts of the business (+)
• lower FSD revenue recognition YoY due to FSD Beta wide release in North America in Q4`22 (-)

Our operating income decreased YoY to $2.1B in Q4, resulting in an 8.2% operating margin. YoY, operating income was primarily impacted by the following items:
• increase in operating expenses partly driven by AI and other R&D projects (-)
• lower FSD revenue recognition YoY due to FSD Beta wide release in North America in Q4`22 (-)

While it did not impact Operating Income, we did record a one-time non-cash tax benefit of $5.9B in Q4 for the release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets.

Quarter-end cash, cash equivalents and investments increased sequentially by $3.0B to $29.1B in Q4, driven by free cash flow of $2.1B and financing activities of $0.9B.

Our company is currently between two major growth waves: the first one began with the global expansion of the Model 3/Y platform and the next one we believe will be initiated by the global expansion of the next-generation vehicle platform. In 2024, our vehicle volume growth rate may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023, as our teams work on the launch of the next-generation vehicle at Gigafactory Texas. In 2024, the growth rate of deployments and revenue in our Energy Storage business should outpace the Automotive business.

We have sufficient liquidity to fund our product roadmap, long-term capacity expansion plans and other expenses. Furthermore, we will manage the business such that we maintain a strong balance sheet during this uncertain period.

While we continue to execute on innovations to reduce the cost of manufacturing and operations, over time, we expect our hardware-related profits to be accompanied by an acceleration of AI, software and fleet-based profits.

Cybertruck production and deliveries will ramp throughout this year. In addition, we continue to make progress on our next generation platform.

• Two additional things about the U.S. market
• Cap Ex for 2024 to be over $10 billion
• One again, thanks to everybody at Tesla, investors, and suppliers
• Given that you moved the production of next-gen vehicle to Austin, may we see the vehicle in 2025?
• Elon - I am often optimistic, I don't want to blow your minds, but our current schedule says that we ill start production towards the end of 2025
• that is just what our current schedule says

• the tech we are developing for the car will apply to Optimus easily
• By far the most sophisticated humanoid robot being developed anywhere in the world
• I think we got a good chance of shipping some Optimus units next year
• but this is a brand new product, and it is hard to make a precise prediction
• we will be updating the public with progress on Optimus very regularly
• I was in the Optimus lab late last night
• The team is doing amazing work
• that's obviously a case where we want to make sure that Optimus is safe at scale
• and make it impossible to upload malware to a humanoid robot
• we're gonna want to localize shutoff that can't be controlled from a central server
• we have to give extreme thought to safety
• I do think it has the potential to be the most valuable product ever
• We can get it to walk around, but we want utility before mass production
• a small robot capable of doing generalized tasks is what it will be
• as we improve the tech in the car, we improve the tech in the robot
• we're really building the future
• the Optimus lab looks like the set of Westworld...
• Reservation to order conversion rate has been encouraging
• We will soon sell out of all of those in 2024
• we are now all hands on deck focused on ramping

• Eww, Tesla uses Teams for these calls
• thoughts on if Tesla is more like a tech company or more like an industrial company that could hit a wall on cost cuts
• CFO - we are constantly looking for what we can do to reduce costs
• the team is constantly going to where we can reduce costs further
• probably not going to be cutting costs as rapdily as recent years going forward
• more that we're still chasing
• kudos to both manufacturing and supply chain team from the CFO
• Do not project past cost cuts into the future
• bigger we become, the more we put into efficiency
• We are also getting into tiers of supply chain to negotiate pricing
• We are not static on the design side
• Our car is more computer than car
• Elon - we have a crazy amount of compute in our cars

• it makes us hard to copy
• you have to copy the machine that makes the machine that makes the machine
• your release does not mention dojo? Any update on that?
• Elon - The AI part of your question is a deep one
• We're obviously hedging our bets here with our NVIDIA chip orders
• A lot of our progress in FSD is training limited
• It's much like a human
• The more you put into training, the less you need to put into inference
• We need a lot of training
• we're pursuing the dual path of NVIDIA and Dojo
