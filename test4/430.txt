Tesla TSLA CEO Elon Musk and Meta Platform Inc’s META founder Mark Zuckerberg added a new and somewhat bizarre dimension to their long-standing rivalry.

What Happened: On Sunday, Musk resorted to an unorthodox and controversial insult, calling Zuckerberg a "cuck" on Twitter, the social media platform he owns.

The unfolding drama caught the attention of users when the official Wendy’s Co WEN account on Meta’s Twitter rival, Threads, humorously suggested that Zuckerberg should "go to space" to make Musk angry — an apparent dig at Musk’s space tourism aspirations and ownership of SpaceX.

What Else Happened: Zuckerberg’s response, a crying laughing emoji, sparked an unexpected reaction from Musk who escalated the feud by proposing a literal “di** measuring contest,” complete with a ruler emoji.

While the unusual nature of the feud is taking the spotlight, it’s worth noting the backdrop against the drama.

Billionaire Feud: Musk and Zuckerberg have been publicly clashing for over six years, with disagreements ranging from artificial intelligence to rocket explosions. Their animosity became public in 2016, when a SpaceX rocket explosion destroyed a Facebook satellite, and has only escalated since.

Their recent public challenge to a physical cage match is the latest manifestation of the rivalry.

Musk’s comments and Zuckerberg’s responses provoked mixed reactions online. Some Twitter users laud Musk for championing free speech, while others express frustration with what they perceive as an unseemly spectacle.

Business Insider captured the sentiments of many by pleading, “Someone, please, make it stop.”

Despite the concerns of onlookers and the occasional intervention of peacemakers like Musk’s mother, Maye Musk, the tech titans show no signs of toning down their rivalry. While it's currently unknown whether the proposed contests — physical or otherwise — will come to fruition, the exchange highlights the increasingly personal nature of the feud.

The stakes are high for both Musk and Zuckerberg. As leaders of some of the world’s most influential tech companies, their public clashes could have implications for their businesses and reputations.

The ongoing feud also adds to the narrative about the increasing tension among tech industry leaders.

The Question Remains: Will there be a cage match, or even a less traditional contest as Musk suggested? And how will it impact their respective businesses?
