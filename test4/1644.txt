BRAD SMITH: Switching gears here, let's take a look at one top trending ticker on "Yahoo Finance", Tesla-- TSLA is the ticker there. EV maker reportedly temporarily halting most production out of its Berlin gigafactory for the next two weeks, according to Reuters. "Yahoo Finance's" Pras Subramanian joins us with the details. Hey, Pras.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Thank you, Brad. So yeah, that disruption in the Red Sea affecting transport through the Suez Canal. So basically, Tesla, presumably, has to get these parts from Asia. They go through that channel to Berlin. That's going to be closed now for--

Well, I mean, right now, it's disrupted because of the ongoing operations there. So suppliers got to go around that, maybe it goes below the tip of Africa, which is a very, very long and treacherous sort of journey. So they're pausing production there for about a little less than two weeks in Berlin.

We're seeing that-- Berlin isn't the most productive factory Tesla has, but they probably produce around 4,000 to 5,000 model Y's a week. So that is significant in terms of the disruption there-- about 10,000 vehicles perhaps. But yeah, it's unsure on the impact on production for the whole quarter, but this is not an insignificant disruption there.

SEANA SMITH: So we're seeing this headline put a bit of pressure on shares this morning. We're also getting some news out that Tesla is once again cutting prices in China on two of its models, I believe. Obviously, the pressure here being some concerns about margins, and what that could look like in the near term.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, and we saw this happen at the end of 2022, beginning of 2023. The price wars are back in China in full effect here. So the Model 3 sedan getting cut by 5.9% to around $34,000 or 246,000 yuan, the Model Y SUV by 2.8% to around 260,000 yuan or so, thereabouts. So yeah, these are not small price cuts.

They're actually pretty significant as this sort of market in China is just super competitive. And new vehicles from NIO, from-- also from BYD just announced recently at the higher end too where Tesla operates, so not just the cheap EVs, the more expensive ones.

And this has the industry is going to actually potentially contract next year. The CPAC, which tracks car sales in China says, it might contract by 11% next year. In terms of less smaller growth but not as much growth as last year. So there is more competition and possibly fewer things to buy or fewer customers to buy these products.

SEANA SMITH: All right, Pras, thanks so much for the latest on that again. That Tesla stock to keep on your radar here this morning throughout the trading day. All right, Pras, thanks.
