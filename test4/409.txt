Kirkhorn sold 3,750 Tesla shares, which wad vested as part of his options award. The sale, apparently done on Wednesday, was in accordance with the 10b5-1 adopted in July 2022.

Over the past three months, the executive has cumulatively sold $4.076 million shares.

Tesla shares have run up since May after a period of lull and are up about 130% this year. The company recently reported stellar second-quarter deliveries and the focus now shifts to its quarterly earnings report due on July 19.
