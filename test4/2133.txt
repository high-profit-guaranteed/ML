Tesla trades on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker symbol TSLA. Tesla does not have a direct stock purchase option unless you are employed by Tesla. If you would like to buy Tesla stocks, you need to go through a broker.

Additionally, you have several options. You can try short-selling Tesla stock, sell or keep your Tesla stock depending on its performance or look into Tesla stock options.

If you do not have a brokerage account, you need to open one to be able to buy TSLA shares. As a general rule of thumb, don’t invest more money than you can afford to lose.

Once you have your brokerage account set up, you can either buy a Tesla stock at market price or choose to buy a call or a put option on the Tesla stock. If you choose to buy it at market price, you can hold onto the stock indefinitely or till you want to sell.

However, if you are purchasing a call or put option, it is only tradable up to a limited time. If you are buying a call option, you would want the stock value of Tesla to go up before trading it.

On the other hand, if you are buying a put option, you would want the stock value of Tesla to go down before trading it. To know more about the difference in buying a call option and buying a put option, click here.

A strike price is the price that you are willing to pay to buy a stock option at a premium. For instance, if Tesla stock is currently valued at a market price of $664, you could set a strike price of $650 to buy put options.

Shortly, if Tesla's stock value dips below your strike price of $650, you could sell the put options at that time to turn a profit. In this case, if the Tesla stock dipped to $640, you could make a profit of $10 per put, minus the premium.

Every put-and-call option bought comes with an expiration date. Post expiration date the options held by the investor become invalid. The expiration date can be set anywhere between 1 week to 2 months or even several years.

Be wise while setting an expiration date, as it provides the window of opportunity to freely trade your call and put options. Remember that the longer you set an expiration date, the more premium you will pay on the options purchased.

Step 4: Decide how many contracts you want.

Each call or put option that you purchase of a particular stock is issued with a contract for 100 shares of stock. Depending on your budget and how you feel about a company’s prospects, you can decide the number of contracts you want to buy. You can also consult a broker or a financial advisor to help you decide.

Is Tesla stock overvalued? It can be at times, but you may hold the stock long enough to extract value from your holdings. Some people ask themselves, “Should I sell Tesla stock,” because they’re not sure if it can rise any higher or if it will be overtaken by other EV manufacturers.

The 12-month average price target of Tesla stock is $455, with a high estimate of $788 and a low estimate of $60, according to the NASDAQ. Based on Tesla’s recent performance in the market, you should give yourself more than 1 week to take advantage of the stock options. While you hold onto Tesla stocks, you can keep a close watch on its day-to-day valuations here.

As you check up on Tesla stock, remember that the Tesla stock discussion is not 100% positive. Tesla has issues of its own from its planned factory in Wolfsburg to reliability and Elon Musk’s public persona that could turn out to be a little less than positive.
• Tesla’s infamous CEO Elon Musk has a reputation for being eccentric. From twisted tweets to risky relationships, Musk’s questionable actions have a direct impact on Tesla’s stock value. It comes as no surprise that a supervising board has been appointed to monitor Musk’s behavior.
• In fact, Musk’s online presence serves as an advertisement for other things like cryptocurrencies, SpaceX and anything else that might pique his interest.
• Tesla’s daily stock value has been volatile to say the least.
• Tesla stocks do not pay dividends to its investors.
• Tesla vehicles have been hit with accusations that they are unreliable, unsafe, poorly built, etc. While it’s difficult to sus out the complexities of a modern vehicle and the technology behind it, stock prices tend to rise and fall with the news cycle.
• Elon Musk seems to be spread thin as news reports from early 2023 note that he’s been sleeping in the Twitter HQ, selling off items from within the office, etc.
• The highly volatile stock price of Tesla gives investors a fair chance to sink their teeth into its stock without burning a hole in their pockets.
• According to a CNBC report, Elon Musk has increased his net worth by $140 billion, due in large part to the 650% rise in TSLA stock. If you had invested $1,700 on 100 shares of TSLA stock during its initial public offering in 2010, you would have made $63,300 profit on the stock at current market prices.
• Tesla is the first automobile company to go public since Ford in 1956. As of March 2020, Tesla is valued at a market capitalization of $627.29 billion. That’s more than General Motors and Ford combined.
• From self-driving cars to sustainable and economic energy reserves for your home, Tesla is always ahead of the curve when it comes to innovation.
• Tesla has shipped more than 139,000 electric vehicles in the third quarter of 2020. Although plans plans to open a factory in Germany have been delayed, Tesla has a relatively new manufacturing plant in Shanghai, China and is geared up to grow in 2021.
• Tesla has been able to deliver a record number of electrical vehicles in the face of a global pandemic and economic recession in 2020.

Electric vehicles (EVs) and the electric-vehicle sector have become increasingly popular in recent years. EV investors initially flocked to Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), although the newly public company Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ: RIVN) has become one of Tesla’s main competitors in the EV market. Now that Rivian has had its initial public offering (IPO), you can invest in either of these publicly traded EV stocks if you think the EV market sector will remain favorable. In this article, Benzinga examines both companies to explain why Rivian likely represents a better investment value than Tesla, especially given the wide disparity of their stocks’ current prices.

Founded in 2009 by RJ Scaringe, Rivian is an electric vehicle manufacturer based in Irvine, California. The company’s original name was Mainstream Motors, which was later changed to Avera Automotive. The company then became Rivian Automotive in 2011 and retains a focus on the manufacture of electric and autonomous vehicles.



Rivian Automotive Inc. went public on Nov. 10 in an IPO priced at $78 per share. The initial offering saw sales of as many as 153 million shares and raised a total of $12 billion for the company’s future growth. The IPO valued the company at $66.5 billion, although the stock opened at $106.75 and closed trading on its first day at $100.73 per share, thereby valuing the company at $86 billion. The valuation was more than that of traditional automaker Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F), which was also one of Rivian’s largest financial backers.

Rivian’s main manufacturing plant is located in Normal, Illinois, and it maintains additional facilities in Carson, California; Wittman, Arizona; Plymouth, Michigan; Vancouver, British Columbia (Canada); and Woking, England. As of December, the company has plans to build another $5 billion plant in Georgia.

Rivian’s growth has been exponential in recent years. Although the company had just 100 employees at the end of 2016, it grew to employ 3,000 people by November 2020. As of its IPO date in November 2021, the company had more than 9,000 employees.

Rivian currently makes two electric vehicles. The first is the R1T, a truck with four electric motors. The second is the R1S, a sport utility vehicle (SUV) that shares the electric chassis of the R1T.

Rivian began deliveries of its R1T Launch Edition in October with a price tag of $75,000, excluding the $1,075 destination charge for delivery. The R1S is expected to begin deliveries sometime in early 2022 and will be priced at $70,000.

Like most EV manufacturers, Rivian’s EV manufacturing is based on a “skateboard” automotive platform or chassis, a self-contained unit that significantly cuts the manufacturing costs of EVs. Rivian’s EV automotive chassis serves as a base platform for its vehicles.



Rivian’s skateboard chassis includes the electric motor, batteries and other electrical components used in its EVs. It also includes removable units at the wheels that house the steering, powertrain, suspension and braking systems.

How Does Tesla Compare to Rivian?

Tesla Inc. went public on June 29, 2010, at an opening price of $17 per share after having been a private company since 2003. Tesla’s stock has soared and currently trades at $1,082.12 per share. If you had purchased 1,000 shares of Tesla at its IPO price of $17 per share in 2010 for $17,000, your stock would now be worth $1,082,120 at current prices.

Tesla was the first U.S. automaker to go public in 54 years at the time of its IPO, and it continues to be the leader in electric car manufacturing. Despite having only a roughly 3.66% share of the U.S. automobile market, Tesla’s market capitalization of $1.075 trillion is more than the world’s nine largest automakers combined.

Tesla’s trailing 12-month average earnings per share (EPS) is only $3.06, which makes its price-to-earnings ratio (PE) approximately 350. This means that at Tesla’s current stock price, the company’s stock is trading at 350 times its earnings, which is massive compared to the average PE ratio in the Group 1 automotive manufacturing sector of 6.23.

Tesla had a very successful year in 2021. The company increased its EV deliveries and profitability and generally set the standard for other EV makers to follow. Despite increasing its production numbers and raising prices on its vehicles, Tesla continues to have a growing order backlog since the demand for EVs has increased significantly in the past year.



While Tesla and Rivian both make EVs, Rivian has is a newly public company and makes only two electric vehicles, neither of which are automobiles. Tesla also has a more developed market that feeds its growing backlog, although increased delivery wait times mean impatient potential customers may decide to buy a competing EV.

Tesla also manufactures batteries and energy generation and storage systems, which provides it with additional revenue and lowers the production costs on its EVs. While not currently in production, Rivian has plans to build a $5 billion battery and assembly plant east of Atlanta that will employ 7,500 people.

For how Tesla stock compares to Rivian’s, Rivian’s stock currently trades at $103 per share and has a trailing 12-month EPS of a loss of $25.37. The company’s market capitalization is $91.36 billion, less than ⅒ of Tesla’s market cap.

Rivian began deliveries of its R1T truck in October and has considerable backing from Ford and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN). Amazon has ordered a significant number of Rivian’s EV trucks for its product deliveries.



Rivian stock recently began trading publicly and has considerable room to grow. In contrast, Tesla’s stock has a decade of trading history and currently trades at 10 times Rivian’s stock price and roughly 350 times earnings, while Rivian has yet to make a profit.

Rivian’s stock price has shown considerable volatility since the stock began trading publicly in November. After going public at $78 per share, the stock has traded as high as $179.47 and as low as $88.40.

At its current stock price, Rivian has a market cap of $93.3 billion. Although it is a relatively new addition to the automobile manufacturing industry, Rivian’s market cap already dwarfs Ford Motor Co.’s at $83 billion and General Motors Co.’s (NYSE: GM) at $82.9 billion, although it is still far below Tesla’s massive market cap of more than $1 trillion.

Even though Rivian isn’t expected to show profits for some time, its stock price reflects the public’s expectation of substantial future growth and profitability. As the company develops its markets and infrastructure, which will include a network of charging stations and a battery manufacturing plant, the price of its stock will most likely continue to appreciate ahead of these developments in anticipation of their arrival.

Tesla’s stock has performed phenomenally well over the past decade and has been one of the best-performing stocks in recent history. After range trading for years, Tesla’s stock price exploded to the upside after the beginning of 2020, rallying tenfold from less than $100 per share to its current price of more than $1,000 per share, as you can see from the price chart below.

Does Rivian Have a Better Outlook Than Tesla?

Tesla’s stock price has already appreciated considerably and has doubled over the past year alone. Even though the outlook for Tesla’s stock remains positive, in large part because of the company’s substantial order backlog, the price of its stock may find tough resistance at its all-time high of $1,243.49 on Nov. 4.

In contrast, Rivian only recently offered shares to the public, and its stock trades at ⅒ the price of Tesla stock. While both stocks have a positive outlook for future appreciation, Rivian’s stock price could appreciate considerably more than Tesla’s in percentage terms because its stock was just offered for sale to the public. Investors also need to consider whether they’ll get a better return on 10 shares of Rivian or one share of Tesla.



Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has a number of other ventures, including SpaceX, which could indirectly affect the price of Tesla’s stock. Musk recently hinted at a possible bankruptcy risk for SpaceX because of a lack of progress on engines that created a "genuine risk of bankruptcy … if we cannot achieve a Starship flight rate of at least once every two weeks next year.” 



Musk has already been a heavy seller of Tesla around present levels in recent months, but if he has to bail out SpaceX financially, he may consider selling even more of his substantial Tesla stock holdings, recently estimated at around 17.63% of outstanding shares, to raise liquid capital. This could put significant pressure on Tesla’s stock price.

Today, Tesla finds itself in an exclusive category. Despite having an operating history of less than two decades, Tesla stock commands a market capitalization of nearly $633 billion, making it the world’s most valuable automaker — and it’s not even close. Consider that at this moment, Tesla is worth more than twice the value of auto manufacturing giant Toyota (NYSE: TM).

While no one can perfectly predict the future, the dramatic success of Tesla stock may rise should consumer behaviors continue on their implied trajectory. First, younger generations — millennials and Generation Z — place a premium on corporate social responsibility efforts. It’s no stretch to assume, then, that modern consumers will also place a greater emphasis on environmental responsibility.

Indeed, evidence indicates that people across all demographics realize the importance of sustainability. A July 2020 McKinsey & Company survey revealed that because of the COVID-19 pandemic, a vast majority of European consumers believed businesses should focus more intently on reducing pollution. Further, 57% of survey respondents declared that they made significant lifestyle changes to reduce their carbon footprint.

And don’t assume that the U.S. is lagging in this department. According to a Pew Research Center report, most Americans support measures to address climate change. This dynamic helps explain why Tesla stock and its EVs captured the public’s imagination: By driving these sleek machines, consumers can have their cake and eat it too.

Not surprisingly, legacy automakers have caught on, with many eagerly developing their own EVs to compete with Tesla. Although the TSLA fanbase remains confident that the underlying company can fend off would-be rivals, shareholders should at least be aware of the challenges in the next phase of the electric mobility revolution.

Below are key factors to consider:
• Ubiquity and its liability: While it’s true that Tesla’s pioneering ethos and innovative approach made EVs almost ubiquitous, down the road, this attribute can become a liability. For instance, the first set of Tesla buyers felt special, essentially becoming personal mobility pioneers. But as Tesla expands its brand by offering more options — particularly the relatively cost-friendly Model 3 — the company will invariably introduce a “sameness” to EVs. This backdrop provides a perfect opportunity for big-name rivals — think Mercedes-Benz or BMW — to jump in and provide some much-needed diversity.
• Economics matter: Ample evidence indicates that throughout the world, environmental advocacy groups succeeded in evangelizing the importance of sustainability to customers. Up to a certain point, people will choose the environmentally responsible product over the less sustainable one. However, a separate McKinsey survey of U.S. consumers revealed that price and other attributes were more important than sustainability. Despite Tesla’s efforts to provide reasonably priced EVs, even its cheapest models are incredibly pricey for the average household. This circumstance opens the door for lower-cost vehicle competitors.
• Legacy relevance: Although Tesla stock skyrocketed on the mainstreaming of EVs, you don’t want to make the mistake of thinking the legacy automakers are irrelevant. On the contrary, it may take decades for electrically powered competitors to usurp their fossil-fueled counterparts. According to the Brookings Institution, it’s difficult for modern societies to quit “dirty energy” because fossil fuels carry incredibly high energy density. Nowadays, it’s not unusual for contemporary cars to travel 30 miles on a single gallon of gasoline. Unfortunately, electric vehicle batteries don’t have nearly the same energy density.
• Infrastructure dependency: Unlike EVs, the infrastructure for combustion-based cars already exists. Therefore, to convince the masses to make the switch, both governments and corporations must invest heavily in charging station infrastructure. Without this rollout, it’s improbable that electric automakers will overtake their traditional counterparts. Keep in mind that only 63% of U.S. housing units have a garage or carport, limiting the pool of consumers that can charge their vehicles at home.
• Innovation is universal: Undeniably, a major draw for Tesla stock is that the underlying company continues to pour millions of dollars into research and development, manufacturing vehicles that rival their combustion counterparts in features, conveniences and most importantly, range. However, legacy automakers are also busy innovating. Today’s combustion cars are much more efficient than ever while significantly mitigating their emissions output.

While Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) didn’t invent the electric vehicle, you can make a strong argument that it was the one brand that made it fashionable. Before its debut, automakers developed hybrid vehicles combining combustion engines with electric propulsion systems. As well, the auto industry experimented with fully electric cars.

But it wasn’t until Tesla came along that electric vehicles (EVs) could be both environmentally friendly and cater to consumer desires. Thanks to blistering performance statistics and sleek design elements, driving electric vehicles became less of an obligatory duty to save the planet but rather a privilege.

Also known as Li Xiang, Li Auto is one of many Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers flexing their muscles. Beyond that, the company generated incredible growth. In 2019, Li Auto saw revenue of only $41 million. But in the pandemic-disrupted year of 2020, the upstart enterprise sent a shot across the bow with sales of $1.45 billion. Better yet, momentum continues to blossom, with the company ringing up $549 million in the top line, good for a 354% year-over-year increase.

Quickly becoming one of China’s flagship enterprises, Nio took its design and strategy cues from Tesla. By developing the Nio EP9, the company proved that Chinese automakers — which previously never enjoyed a strong reputation for building cars — can hang with the best of them. As well, the company introduced a range of models that fit a wide pricing spectrum. Because of its desirability and accessibility, NIO currently commands a market cap of nearly $75 billion.

An interesting inclusion among EV debutantes, Nikola is the anti-Tesla. Throughout its marketing campaign, Nikola goaded Tesla into a war of words on social media. Unfortunately for the upstart, a short-selling research firm accused the organization of multiple business improprieties. Nevertheless, NKLA stock gained a cult following, possibly providing upside opportunities for speculators.

One of the most discussed EV competitors, Workhorse was the only all-electric platform bid competing for the contract to replace the U.S. Postal Service’s aging fleet of mail-carrier vehicles. Though it seemed a no-brainer at the time, the USPS eventually awarded the multibillion-dollar deal to Oshkosh (NYSE: OSK), a defense contractor. Still, speculators are holding out hope that Workhorse’s legal complaint can generate some traction.

Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) has been a popular stock among investors, and CEO Elon Musk’s rise to prominence has only brought more attention to the company. However, the stock has been less than compelling in 2022, with the electric vehicle (EV) giant facing headwinds, such as Federal Reserve rate hikes, China’s zero-COVID policy and Musk’s acquisition and involvement with Twitter.

The Twitter takeover has been a major headwind in recent months, and investors will be hoping that the stock performs better over the coming years.

With Musk venturing into new businesses and selling a portion of his Tesla shares this year, what can investors expect going forward?

Where Will Tesla Stock Be in 2025?

Musk has been heavily scrutinized over a perceived lack of focus on Tesla. Therefore, strong leadership is essential to avoid further declines. So, where could Tesla stock be in 2025?

Looking forward, the stock has yet to escape constant external headwinds. Supply chain challenges linger for automakers, and historically high inflation is expected to reduce customer spending on household goods and vehicles.

Bears have taken over in 2022, and difficulties for Tesla are unlikely to disappear in the near term. Competition among EV manufacturers continues to increase each year, although Tesla remains dominant across the U.S. market.

Global demand remains a big question for the firm, especially with supply chain issues across China. If Tesla wants to reach its previous highs and continue its rapid growth, a change in the current macro environment is probably essential.

Investors doubt Tesla’s potential stock price growth over the next year. However, many of the problems remaining are external, and future earnings depend on the global economic climate.

It is likely that EV sales will be impacted by a weak economy. But higher interest rates and a declining economy will not continue forever. Tesla could take action to drive demand for its products.

Many predict further price cuts and discounts for Tesla in 2023. While this action may reduce profit, it will likely drive sales, potentially encouraging EV adoption and hopefully pushing its stock higher. Tesla remains one of the most profitable EV makers because of its significantly high vehicle sales prices.

Despite short-term headwinds, long-term growth is still in sight, and another factor that should help stabilize its share price is Musk’s pledge not to sell more Tesla stock through 2025. Whether investors believe him is another question.

A legitimate question exists as to whether Tesla is overvalued, even after the significant decline.

Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas notes that Tesla shed $600 billion in market value in just three months. With Tesla as an “ambassador” for EVs, the significant valuation decline “raises questions for investment returns” across the sector.

Tesla price cuts have begun in China, and Jonas expects this process to continue in the U.S. and Europe. Even so, the analyst, a Tesla bull, views the significant pullback in its shares as a buying opportunity for investors.

It could take months before Tesla shares show signs of a recovery, and while a substantial run higher once again is not out of the question over the next few years, it is still questionable, given these concerns.
