Ever since electric vehicles (EVs) joined the automobile industry, debates about their utility and efficiency in comparison to conventional vehicles have been taking place. It is argued that EVs are abundantly more friendly to an environment that is already suffering at the hands of carbon emissions and pollution and that they are exceptionally efficient in terms of energy consumption. Governments across the world are attempting to promote electric vehicles among their citizens by offering public funding to EV manufacturers, subsidies and tax credits to consumers, and so much more that can make the ownership of an EV a possibility for the average person. However, there is some discourse surrounding EVs today that indicates that the exorbitant prices of these innovative and exciting vehicles are discouraging most people from buying and owning EVs.

While demand for EVs may thus seem to be dwindling, this is reportedly not the case for every EV manufacturer out there. For instance, on January 2, Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, joined CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" to discuss the rising demand for one stellar EV manufacturer's vehicles relative to competitors in the EV sector. Here are some of his comments:

On being asked why Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is continuing to see higher demand in 2024, particularly in China in the face of Chinese EV competitors, and whether it can continue to retain its market share, Ives said the following:

Despite the above, it cannot be categorically said that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) will be the only EV stock worth keeping an eye on in 2024. Some of the other best EV stocks, such as NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) and Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN), should also be studied carefully as the year progresses since some professionals in the EV space believe that EV sales will continue to rise this year. On February 8, Le Thi Thu Thuy, the Chairwoman of Vietnam's VinFast, joined CNBC to discuss this. Here is what she had to say:

Provided that the sales of electric vehicles continue to rise in 2024, manufacturers of these vehicles can be expected to rake in some profits. Many investors in the EV space are continuing to bet primarily on Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) as the most renowned name in the sector. However, this does not mean that there is a shortage of small-cap electric vehicle stocks in the market. On the contrary, there are a number of attractive small-cap options in the EV space, many of which could well be on their way to becoming some of the best EV stocks the market has ever seen. Considering how many of these smaller and cheaper stocks are often overlooked by investors, we have decided to compile a list of some of the best small-cap electric vehicle stocks out there today. Some of these names are considered by some to be a few of the best cheap EV stocks to buy.
