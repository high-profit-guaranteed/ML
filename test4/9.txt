Tesla has once again cut prices in an effort to boost demand for its electric vehicles, according to Bloomberg.

The Model S sedan now starts at $84,990, a $5,000 cut from last month's price.

The Model X starts at $94,990, also a $5,000 drop.

The automaker delivered 422,875 vehicles globally in the first quarter. Shares have advanced over 50% this year, exceeding the S&P 500's 7% rise.

The S and X models made up just 10,695 of those deliveries.

Other Teslas, such as the Model 3 sedans and Model Y sports utility vehicles saw their prices trimmed by $1,000 and $2,000, respectively, bringing those starting prices to $41,990 and $49,900, according to its website.

Tesla did a round of price cuts in the U.S. in January, reducing prices by 20% as a way to likely allow some buyers to qualify for a $7,500 U.S. government tax credit.

That reduction on the Model Y crossover brought the vehicle below a $55,000 cap, making it eligible for the tax incentive.

A 14% cut brought the price of a high-performance version of its Model 3 sedan to $53,990, also putting it under the cap.
