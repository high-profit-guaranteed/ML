Shares of Tesla, Inc. TSLA could extend its losses on Thursday amid a general rise in risk aversion toward growth stocks and some company-specific news.

Bond yields continue to creep higher following the “higher rates for longer” message relayed by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday. The 10-year Treasury note yield rose to a fresh high of 4.445% on Thursday, the highest since Oct. 31, 2007.

Higher yields make investment in high-growth tech stocks, which often carry a high price/earnings multiple unattractive. Tesla, for one, has a forward P/E multiple of a loft 60.

Also, a drone videographer, who regularly updates activities in Tesla’s Giga Texas factory, said production at the plant may remain suspended until September due to factory upgrades ahead of the Cybertruck launch. The company is also stymied by the depletion in the Model 3 inventory ahead of the Model 3 refresh unveiling.
