The Electric Vehicle (EV) industry leader Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) missed estimates for its third-quarter vehicle deliveries, as production halts were caused by factory upgrades to produce its Model 3 mass-market sedan.

The company, which is aggressively cutting prices to fend off competition, handed over 435,059 vehicles in the quarter ended September 30, down about 7% from the prior quarter, while an LSEG poll of analysts estimated deliveries of 459,949 vehicles.

TSLA is also facing a sales drop in its China-made EVs. China Passenger Car Association said sales of the company’s China-made EVs decreased 10.9% year-over-year for September.

Given this backdrop, let’s look at the trends of TSLA’s key financial metrics to understand why it could be wise to avoid the stock now.

The trend and fluctuations of the Return On Sales (ROS) for TSLA during the period from December 31, 2020, to June 30, 2023, are visually represented in the following points:
• None There’s a clear upward trend in the ROS from December 2020 to December 2022, with an increase from 5.6% to 17%. During this timeframe, the growth rate is approximately 203%.

• None Subsequently, the trend across 2021 largely moved downwards until the end of the year, standing at 1.375 by December 31, 2021. This represented a drop of approximately 27% from its starting point at the end of 2020.

Looking at the complete data available, the current ratio has experienced a total increase of approximately 4% from its initial value in December 2020 (1.88) to the last value in June 2023 (1.59). While there have been periods of decline, the recent upward movement indicates a promising prospect for the company’s liquidity status.
