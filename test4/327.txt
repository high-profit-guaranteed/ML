Robinhood Markets Inc HOOD is rolling out 24-hour trading, 5 days a week, in an effort to appeal to investors who want the ability to trade whenever they'd like.

Though the service is not the first of its kind, it is set to bolster the trading prowess of its user base, providing a wider scope of opportunities than traditional market hours.

Available from Sunday 8 p.m. ET to Friday 8 p.m. ET, Robinhood’s 24-hour market offers a list of 43 stocks and ETFs. Investors can place whole-share, limit orders for assets via Robinhood’s app or website.

The feature offers comprehensive time controls, such as Good-For-Day orders which remain active for up to 24 hours and Good-Til-Cancelled orders that stand for up to 90 calendar days.

In addition to Robinhood, other brokers with 24-hour trading include:
• Interactive Brokers offers overnight trading for over 10,000 U.S. stocks and ETFs.
• TD Ameritrade offers 24-hour trading, five days per week for select securities.
