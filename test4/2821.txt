Tesla Inc. TSLA CEO Elon Musk disagrees with Nvidia Corp.'s NVDA CEO Jensen Huang’s belief about the ease of creating neural networks with his company’s AI chips.

What Happened: Musk responded to Huang’s claim that anyone could create a neural network using Nvidia chips. Musk’s rebuttal came via a post on Friday.

To recall, Huang said in February that "AI factories" will one day take over the world, in every industry, region, and company.

According to Huang, AI factories take "raw material, which is data, it transforms it with these AI supercomputers that Nvidia builds, and it turns them into incredibly valuable tokens.”

He had previously said "Everybody in the world is now a programmer" thanks to generative AI, and that it has "killed" coding. He believes that every enterprise on the planet will eventually run on Nvidia's "AI operating system."

But Musk thinks it is difficult – and this comes when Tesla has invested in 10,000 H100 GPUs to create its neural network for its full self-driving (FSD) technology.

Why It Matters: In February, Huang predicted that “AI factories” would eventually take over the world, asserting their presence in every industry, company, and region.

He also expressed optimism about Nvidia’s software segment, citing the company’s achievement of a $1 billion annualized revenue run rate in the segment.

In March, Huang further asserted Nvidia’s technological dominance in the AI industry, stating that their GPUs remain unrivaled, even against freely offered competitor AI chips.

Despite Huang’s confidence in Nvidia’s AI capabilities, Musk’s recent statement emphasizes the complexity of developing neural networks.
