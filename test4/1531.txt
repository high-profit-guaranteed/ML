Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM) is navigating a fiercely competitive chip industry. However, the company’s prospects remain uplifted amid the competition between the United States and China for tech supremacy.

TSM unveiled its N2 Prototype this year, which is expected to provide up to 10% higher performance and 30% lower power consumption than the company’s existing 5 nm process. This advanced semiconductor technology is set to enter volume production in 2025 and could be a game-changer for the company.

Moreover, auto industry giant Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) is on track to adopt TSM’s 3nm chips in 2024, underpinning a growing demand for the company’s chips. As TSLA joins TSM’s N3P customer list, reflecting a strategic win for both companies, the chip company’s revenue growth trajectory should receive a boost.

TSM’s stock closed the last trading session at $104.45, higher than the 50-day moving average of $96.08 and 200-day moving average of $93.94, underscoring a strong momentum in its stock prices.

Under such circumstances, TSM’s prospects appear bright, which should make the stock appealing to potential investors. Let’s look at the trends of its key financial metrics to gain further insight.

Analyzing Financial Performance and Market Trends of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited

The following are the trends and fluctuations of the trailing-12-month revenue of TSM:
• None As of December 2020, TSM reported a revenue of $46.99 billion, which slightly increased to $48.17 billion within the same month.
• None In the first quarter of 2021 (March 31), there was a minor increase in revenue to $49.68 billion. The trend continued upwards throughout the entire year of 2021, with revenue standing at $52.25 billion (June), $54.34 billion (September), and a slightly higher growth rate toward the end of the year as it hit $56.69 billion in December.
• None The year 2022 showed significant strides in growth. Starting with a revenue figure of $58.17 billion in March, a leap to $62.6 billion by the end of June, and another slight increase to $64.89 billion in September. This rapid growth rate intensified in December, when the revenue ascended to $75.21 billion, marking the highest record in this period.
• None However, in 2023, a downward trend became apparent, starting at $74.15 billion in March, further dropping to $71.21 billion in June, and finishing the third quarter at $66.66 billion in September.

In summary, TSM’s financial trends show a positive growth rate from December 2020 until December 2022, followed by a downturn heading into 2023. From the initial value in December 2020 to the last recorded value in September 2023, revenue demonstrated a notable growth rate, albeit with some levels of volatility.

The trend of the gross margin for TSM has generally been increasing over the course of the data provided. Here are significant observations:
• None In December 2020, the gross margin stood at 53.1%.
• None By the end of March 2021, there was a slight increase to 53.2%, but this trend did not continue in the subsequent quarters, with a drop to 52.4% in June 2021 and a further decline to 51.9% in September 2021.
• None The lowest point was reached in December 2021, where the gross margin fell to 51.6%.
• None However, from the start of 2022, TSM experienced consistent growth in gross margin. It rose to 52.6% in March 2022, 55% in June 2022 and then 57.3% by September 2022.
• None The peak was witnessed at the end of 2022, reaching 59.6%.
• None In 2023, although the margin slightly increased to 59.7% in March, it experienced a decline in the following months, falling to 58.6% in June and then 57% in September.

In summary, the gross margin for TSM fluctuated over time but saw a net overall growth of approximately 4.9% between December 2020 and September 2023.

The trend and fluctuations in the Return on Sales (ROS) of TSM are as follows:
• None Starting from the end of December 2020, TSM’s ROS was reported at 0.44.
• None There was a consistent value of 0.44 till March 2021.
• None A slight decrease was observed in the subsequent quarters, with 0.43 in June 2021 and further decreasing to 0.42 in September and December 2021.
• None The first quarter of 2022 saw an uptick in the ROS back to 0.43, indicating the beginning of an upward trend.
• None The steady quarterly increase continued through the rest of 2022. From 0.46 in June, culminating at 0.51 by the end of the year in December 2022.
• None However, the upward journey was short-lived; in 2023, a clear downward trend commenced. A slightly diminished ROS of 0.50 was reported in June 2023, further dropping to 0.49 by the end of September 2023.

Calculating the growth rate from the values of the last (September 2023 – 0.49) and the first (December 2020 – 0.44), we can see an overall increase of approximately 11% over the period under consideration.

It is important to put greater emphasis on the more recent data. Notably, the last three quarters (from January 2023 to September 2023) have seen a steady downward trend from 0.51 to 0.49. This contrasts with the strong upward trend seen throughout 2022.
• None TSM’s current ratio recorded a significant increase over the observed period, growing from 1.73 as of December 31, 2020, to 2.15 by the end of the third quarter in 2023.
• None The growth rate of the current ratio, measured by the change in the last value compared to the first, indicates a significant growth of approximately 24.28%.
• None Throughout the period, there have been fluctuations in the current ratio. Specifically, in the first quarter of each year, slight dips have been observed, followed by increases in the second quarter.
• None Despite these fluctuations, a consistent overall upward trend has emerged. The peak was reached in the third quarter of 2022 when the current ratio hit 2.49.
• None Greater emphasis on more recent data reveals that for most of 2023, the current ratio has been above 2. Noteworthy is the drop from 2.42 in June 2023 to 2.15 in September 2023, a quarterly decrease of 11.23%, illustrating the volatility of this ratio.

In summary, TSM has shown an overall upward trend in the current ratio over the historical period, indicating an improving liquidity condition.

Over the duration from June 2023 to December 2023, TSM has performed quite distinctively across various dimensions of the POWR Ratings. Focusing on the three most noteworthy dimensions, namely Momentum, Quality and Sentiment, we have found some interesting patterns.

Momentum: This dimension consistently scored extremely high for TSM. Starting with a value of 99 in June 2023, the rating remained steady almost throughout the year, suffering only a slight dip to 98 from August to December 2023.

Quality: Quality started at 97 in June 2023, maintaining this score until July of the same year. This slightly decreased to 94 in August 2023, with a subtle shift upward to 95 by November 2023. It maintained this level through December of the year.

Sentiment: The Sentiment rating exhibited the most fluctuation among the significant dimensions.
