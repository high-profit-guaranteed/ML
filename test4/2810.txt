Tesla (TSLA) has been through a rough patch from recalls to fierce competition in China afflicting the EV maker's first-quarter 2024 performance. Currently, Tesla CEO Elon Musk is disputing a Reuters report citing Tesla's plans to cancel its low-cost EV strategy as it contends with competition in China.

Roth MKM Senior Research Analyst Craig Irwin joins Market Domination to discuss the contested news with Tesla and why he believes, despite the recent slowdown in demand for EVs, he remains bullish long-term on the EV company.

Irwin affirms: "People know me as a bear on Tesla. I'm bearish on the valuation... but I'm a bull on EVs for the long term. Why? Because EVs are so compelling. 65% fewer components. They should be cheaper than ICE [internal combustion engine] vehicles... If price comes down dramatically on these — maybe shorter range, smaller vehicles something comparable to like a Mini Cooper or something like that — you could have a compelling inexpensive vehicle that would be a massive seller in Europe and a great second car here in the US. Yes, price matters."

JULIE HYMAN: Tesla is reportedly canceling its plans for a low cost car. This is according to Reuters. Tesla CEO Elon Musk took to social media to say in an ex post that Reuters is lying again.

For more on this, let's bring in Roth MKM Senior Research Analyst Craig Irwin. So, Craig, Reuters citing various internal memos, as well as employees that it spoke with in the source of this report. How seriously are you taking it? And we know already that if they are still planning this car, it's not coming out for a while.

CRAIG IRWIN: Yeah, it is coming out. It's coming out in '25. I expect it to come out. I've been talking about this car since 2019 when they punted on the original production decision.

They were thinking that, jeez, it's going to be margin dilutive versus where they are now actually would have been creative. Reuters probably just caught some lower level employees at one of the factories that has been scratched off the list. And this is why channel checks are difficult.

Sometimes even when you talk to people you think are the right people, they can give you bad information. It's very important to talk to people that operate at the most senior level and have transparency in the industry. The mini car is coming. It's going to be an important part of Tesla's mix going forward.

We don't know exactly where it's going to be made. But chatter is maybe India. The last thinking was Germany.

But is a possibility that it's made in Mexico, or in Fremont, or another facility. So this is influx. It's in development. They're probably working through a bake off, an internal bake off right now. And that's the misunderstanding, I think, that made its way off into the market.

JOSH LIPTON: And, Craig, big picture pricing. Does pricing have to come down if we're going to see a kind of re-acceleration in EV sales? So here's I think. People know me as a bear on Tesla.

I'm bearish on the valuation. But I'm a bull on EVs for the long term. Why? Because EVs are so compelling. 65% fewer components. They should be cheaper than ICE vehicles.

So if price comes down dramatically on these maybe shorter range, smaller vehicles something comparable to like a Mini Cooper or something like that, you could have a really compelling inexpensive vehicle. That would be a massive seller in Europe and a great second car here in the US.

Yes, price matters. Price is extremely important both on the existing units that are offered out there, the different models. But in the longer run, this mini car is essential. And it's essential to the long-term viability.

And, you know, frankly, it'll be a cost puller. It'll help them get cost out in the other areas of the business. And then this modular manufacturing approach, it's going to be transformational. The former Tesla engineers are all telling me pay attention.

You know, Musk can get it right. They all know how skeptical I am. You know, he's always late, but cost is everything.

And when you have a great car that has better integration with technology, and you know, it's cheaper than your ice alternative, you know, it's going to be a compelling future. And that's what Musk building for.
