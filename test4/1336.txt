Baron Partners Fund made the following comment about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

"Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) makes electric vehicles, related software and components, and energy storage products. Shares fell due to softness in the core automotive segment given a complex macroeconomic environment, higher interest rates, factory shutdowns, and Tesla’s price reductions throughout the year. These factors pressured the business’ near-term margin profile. Tesla continues to generate sufficient gross profit to support an attractive product development plan that can propel the automotive segment higher over time. Initial deliveries of the Cybertruck are imminent, and its next platform could represent a material increase in revenues and profits across Tesla’s automotive segment while further differentiating it from competitors. The refreshed Model 3 has generated strong demand indications while also improving unit-level economics. Lastly, while early, we expect Tesla to benefit from its investment in supercomputer Dojo, which specializes in AI for full self-driving."
