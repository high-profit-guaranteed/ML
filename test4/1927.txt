Investors in Tesla Inc TSLA, the electric vehicle pioneer, are closely monitoring a concerning technical indicator — the Death Cross.

This bearish signal, a crossover of the 50-day moving average (yellow line above) below the 200-day moving average (blue line above), has historically been associated with potential downward trends in stock prices. As Tesla grapples with various challenges, the emergence of a death cross adds a new layer of uncertainty for shareholders.

A death cross is interpreted as a sign of weakening momentum. It’s often viewed by technical analysts as a signal that a stock’s upward trend may be reversing. In the context of Tesla’s stock, this development has sparked concerns among investors who have been accustomed to the company’s volatile yet generally upward trajectory.

Tesla stock has had a good run in 2023, delivering 130% return to investors. 2024 hasn’t been great so far – with the stock down 24% YTD. Some of the recent news and factors that may be behind volatility and downtrend, include:
• Tesla Faces Fresh NHTSA Scrutiny Over Steering Issues In Model 3 And Model Y EVs
• Elon Musk’s Compensation Is ‘Tornado Situation’ For Tesla: Analyst Calls For New Plan To Satisfy CEO, Shareholders
• Tesla Recalls Nearly 200K Vehicles To Fix Rearview Issue Amid Earnings Dip And Elon Musk’s Wealth Decline

• Tesla Analysts Cut Projections After Q4 Results: Stock ‘Egregiously Overvalued,’ ‘Difficult To Get Optimistic’

The death cross in Tesla’s stock chart reflects the ongoing shift in market sentiment, with some investors becoming more cautious about the company’s future prospects.

While technical indicators are not foolproof and must be considered alongside other fundamental factors, the prominence of the death cross highlights the current challenges and uncertainties surrounding Tesla’s stock.

Consensus ratings on Tesla stock currently stand at a Neutral with a price target of $207.80. A quick look at Tesla’s ratings trajectory reveals that a majority of analysts, in January, have maintained or downgraded their ratings on Tesla stock, while reducing their price targets.

It remains to be seen whether the death cross will materialize into a sustained downward trend or if the company can overcome these hurdles. The Austin, Texas-based company’s CEO is Elon Musk. He is often a key influencer of market sentiment and continues to drive ambitious projects.

However, external factors play a significant role in shaping the company’s stock trajectory.
