Tesla (TSLA) has finally unveiled the goodies that can unleash the full potential of a Model S Plaid. Tesla enthusiasts have been waiting for this option since the electric automaker delivered the first Plaid Model S in June 2021.

The automaker is now offering a hardware and software bundle called the Track Package. The Tesla Model S Plaid Track Pack unlocks track-level handling and the much-awaited 200 mph (~322 km/h) top speed. Without the Track Package, Tesla has software-limited the top speed of a Tesla Model S Plaid to around 162 mph or 260 km/h (watch on Autobahn).

The Tesla Model S Plaid Track Package just appeared on the official Tesla online shop and has already gone popular among the Tesla enthusiast community.

Tesla wrote the following description of the Model S Plaid Track Package:

“Designed for the ultimate track experience, the Model S Plaid Track Package delivers high-speed stability, maximum cornering force and repeatable stopping power during high-performance driving while unlocking a top speed of 200 mph.

“The Track Package includes aluminum forged wheels, track-ready tires and brake fluid, new carbon-silicon carbide rotors, and one-piece forged calipers with high-performance pads.

“Our rotors feature continuous-fiber technology and are constructed in a unique 3D matrix to add strength and manage heat more effectively. For additional durability, a ceramic friction layer covers the entire rotor surface to reduce brake dust, corrosion and wear while also improving pedal feel for daily driving.”

The stock brake calipers of the Tesla Model S Plaid have long been a target of criticism by owners and enthusiasts. The braking performance of the car is not at par with these stock brakes, especially on a race track. The Tesla Model S Plaid stock brake calipers are too small for full-throttle experiments with track-level braking.

Although the larger carbon ceramic brakes were available from Tesla’s online shop, they cost a hefty $20,000. Now, in the same price range ($15,000–$20,000), Tesla is offering the entire Track Package, including wheels, tires, single-piece forged brake calipers, brake rotors, brake fluid, and the software update.

Tesla included Goodyear Supercar 3R (Eagle F1) tires in the Model S Plaid Track Package. These are purely summer performance tires and Tesla recommends not to use them in temperatures of 40℉ (5℃) or below.

Here’s the entire list of hardware items included in the Tesla Model S Plaid Track Package:

The availability of the Tesla Model S Plaid Track Package will begin in June 2023 and it can only be ordered by Model S Plaid owners via the Tesla Mobile App.

In addition to the hardware components, the Model S Plaid Track Package also includes customized Track Mode software by Tesla.

The Tesla Model S Plaid has been conquering drag strips since its launch. It will be worth watching the track performance of this luxury family sedan with the new Track Package. However, with 3rd-party customizations such as Unplugged Performance, the Tesla Model S Plaid has already conquered the likes of Pikes Peak and Laguna Seca.
