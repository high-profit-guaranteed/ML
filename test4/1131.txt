Tesla Inc TSLA stock is up 1.35% to $221.45 on Friday, driven by overall market strength following the Federal Reserve's decision this week to keep interest rates unchanged.

What Happened With The Fed?

The Federal Reserve has chosen to keep the federal funds rate steady at a range of 5.25% to 5.5% for the second consecutive time. Fed Chair Jerome Powell conveyed mixed signals during his press conference, rejecting the idea of rate cuts while noting that inflation has not hit the Fed's 2% goal.

Why This Matters To TSLA Investors

Investors often use a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis to value a company's stock. In a DCF analysis, future cash flows are discounted to their present value using an appropriate discount rate. Lower interest rates generally result in a lower discount rate, which means that the future cash flows are worth more in today's dollars.

As interest rates decrease, Tesla's future earnings are perceived as more valuable, potentially leading to an increase in the stock's intrinsic value and share price.

When interest rates are low, fixed-income investments like bonds and savings accounts may offer lower returns. This can make stocks, including Tesla's, more attractive to investors seeking higher potential returns.

With few appealing alternatives, more investors may allocate their capital to equities, leading to increased demand for Tesla's stock and a subsequent rise in its price.

Lower interest rates can also lead to lower interest payments on car loans and mortgages, which, in turn, can increase consumer spending. When consumers have more disposable income due to lower interest expenses, they are more likely to consider purchasing electric vehicles like those produced by Tesla.

Increased demand for Tesla's products can drive up its sales and revenue, positively impacting the stock price.

According to data from Benzinga Pro, TSLA has a 52-week high of $299.29 and a 52-week low of $101.81.
