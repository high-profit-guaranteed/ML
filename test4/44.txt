Tesla Inc. should be punished after a worker at its Shanghai factory was crushed by equipment and died on Feb. 4, Caixin Global reported Wednesday, citing an investigation by local authorities.

The investigation found that Tesla has faults in its risk control measures and should be held responsible, Caixin said. However, it also said that the dead worker was directly responsible too. According to the report, the worker didn’t lock a safety gate during a late shift, and another worker didn’t ensure the zone was clear of people before turning on equipment.
