Benzinga examined the prospects for many investors' favorite stocks over the last week — here's a look at some of our top stories.

Over the last week, both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq recorded losses, with declines of 0.3% and 1.9% respectively, marking back-to-back losing weeks for the first time since Nasdaq's four-week downturn in December 2022. In a departure from this trend, the Dow bucked the pattern, gaining 0.6% over the same period.

Inflation figures have delivered a nuanced picture recently. The consumer price index for July, an essential gauge for market inflation, showed a 3.2% annual increase, slightly below the predicted 3.3%. On the other hand, July's producer price index, which measures the cost of raw goods for wholesalers, edged up by 0.3% from the previous month, further muddying the waters of the inflation landscape.

But inflation data released Friday complicated the picture. July’s producer price index, which tracks the price wholesalers pay for raw goods, rose 0.3% from the previous month.
