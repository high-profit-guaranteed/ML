Netflix’s shares soared over 10% in premarket trading, driven by the announcement of adding more than 13 million subscribers in the last quarter. This surge in subscriber count has taken the total to a record 260.8 million, with revenue and earnings guidance surpassing analyst expectations. Netflix’s performance sets a positive early tone for the market, building upon the momentum gained by mega-cap tech stocks throughout 2024.

In contrast to Netflix, AT&T and Dupont De Nemours saw declines in their stock values, with AT&T slipping over 2% and Dupont tumbling 11% due to weaker-than-expected earnings and guidance. EBay, on the other hand, reported a rise of over 3% following its announcement to reduce its workforce, a decision aimed at aligning expenses with business growth. Abbott Laboratories also experienced a 2% drop despite reporting earnings in line with forecasts.

Traders’ focus remains on earnings reports, with significant announcements expected from Tesla, Las Vegas Sands, and IBM. The anticipation around these reports, especially Tesla’s expected earnings, is high, with over 70% of S&P 500 companies so far surpassing Wall Street expectations.

U.S. Treasury yields were lower, as the market braces for pivotal economic data releases later this week, including the fourth-quarter GDP growth figure and the personal consumption expenditures price index. These reports will be crucial in shaping the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions, which are pivotal for the market and economic outlook in the short term.

In the short term, U.S. stock markets are expected to continue their bullish trend on Wednesday, primarily driven by strong tech sector performances, notably Netflix.

However, investors should stay alert to potential turbulence ahead, given mixed corporate earnings and crucial economic data that could sway market direction and influence Federal Reserve decisions.
