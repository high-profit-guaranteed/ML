Even though 2023 is ready to race away into the past, one parting gift that it's given investors is uncertainty. The year has been full of ups and downs for the stock market, and throughout these past 12 months, investors have watched their investments go up and come down as they scuttle to adjust portfolios on the slightest of whims. 2023 started out by greeting a market that was wary of the Federal Reserve and its interest rate hikes. The Fed, for its part, had entered 2023 by raising rates multiple times by 75 basis points each, and investors, analysts, and economists were worried about the impact of these rates on the economy and particularly high growth technology sectors.

While the stock market itself is an economic barometer, indexes such as the NASDAQ Composite and the S&P 500 often see their performance varies by sector. For instance, last year as technology and growth companies such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) were decimated due to high rates and inflation denting their markets, others such as Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) soared on the back of record high oil prices.

One index that is a better representation of the American economy is the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). One of the oldest stock indexes in the world, the Dow has seen all phases of the stock market's history - from the Great Depression of the 1930s to the Great Recession in 2008. Throughout its life, it has seen numerous companies come and go, and since technology is the biggest sector of the American economy now, several technology companies are now present on the Dow. Being a member allows a firm to take the prestigious title of a blue chip stock, and right now, the Dow is made of 30 companies with the latest changes having taken place in 2020 when Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON), and Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) made the cut and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Exxon, and RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) were given the boot.

Since the Dow is more diversified, its performance doesn't often see breakneck returns like other indexes such as the tech heavy NASDAQ 100. The index's constituents range from financial services to information technology, petroleum exploration, healthcare, retail, construction, semiconductors, and entertainment. So for instance, if semiconductors continue to rise on the back of strong A.I. spending but construction contracts should rates remain high, then the Dow's performance will reflect both these fluctuations. As a consequence, the Dow is up by a modest 9.12% year to date, while other widely known indexes such as the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite have gained 19.8% and 37.98%, respectively.

So, the Dow isn't known for blockbuster returns. This should make one wonder why is it so popular among investors and the media? Well, the answer to this question lies in two words: stability and diversification. Should one simply choose to invest in the index, then while the portfolio won't generate high returns, it would nevertheless prove to be a great buffer during economic turmoil. As an example of this principle, consider that between December 2007 and June 2009, the S&P 500 lost roughly 40% - a disaster that shook the world. However, the DJIA pared off slightly better, as it prevented some of the losses to be down by roughly 35%. Since March 2009, the Dow is up by 396% while the S&P has returned 461%.

But what about stocks? We took a look at the best performing Dow stocks in 2023 as of November 17th 2023, and found that the three highest performers in the index were Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Overall, the top five performing Dow stocks were also technology companies, cementing technology's role as the market's savior in 2023.

Looking at this, it's important to know where the smart money is heading when it comes to Dow and blue chip stocks. We took a look today, and found that the three most unfavorable billionaire Dow stock picks are Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW), and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ).
