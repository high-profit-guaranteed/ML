Tesla is out with the company's Q2 2023 earnings results, and the stock is reacting to the news in after-hours trading. The EV company reported earnings-per-share (EPS) of $0.91/share and revenues of $24.9 billion. Earnings slightly beat the EPS whisper number of $0/89/share and analyst esimates of $0.82/share. Revenues topped analyst estimates as well.

We will be streaming the TSLA Q2 2023 conference call on our Shacknews Twitch channel. Stop by if you want to react to the news in chat.
• $0.7 Billion increase in our cash and investments QoQ to $23.1 Billion
• Model Y became the best-selling vehicle globally in Q1

Q2-2023 was a record quarter on many levels with our best-ever production and deliveries and revenue approaching $25B in a single quarter. We are excited that we were able to achieve such results given the macroeconomic environment we are currently in.

Our operating margin remained healthy at approximately 10%, even with price reductions in Q1 and early Q2. This reflects our ongoing cost reduction efforts, the continued production ramp success in Berlin and Texas and the strong performance of our Energy and Services & Other businesses.

Our commitment to being at the forefront of AI development entered a new chapter with the start of production of Dojo training computers. We are hopeful that our immense neural net training needs will be satisfied using our in-house designed Dojo hardware. The better the neural net training capacity, the greater the opportunity for our Autopilot team to

iterate on new solutions.

In conclusion, we are focusing on cost reduction, new productdevelopment that will enable future growth, investments in R&D, better vehicle financing options, continuous product improvement and generation of free cash flow. The challenges of these uncertain times are not over, but we believe we have the right ingredients for the long-term success of the business through a variety of high potential projects.

Total revenue grew 47% YoY in Q2 to $24.9 Billion. YoY, revenue was impacted by the following items:
• + growth in other parts of the business

Our operating income decreased slightly YoY to $2.4B in Q2, resulting in a 9.6% operating margin. YoY, operating income was primarily impacted by the following items:
• - cost of production ramp of 4680 cells and other related change
• - increase in Operating expenses driven Cybertruck, AI and other large projects
• + growth in vehicle deliveries (despite margin headwind from underutilization of factories)
• + lower cost per vehicle, which includes lower raw material cost and IRA credit
• + gross profit growth in Energy business as well as Services & Other
• Other income (below operating income line) was positively impacted by FX movements on certain intercompany balances.
• Quarter-end cash, cash equivalents and investments increased sequentially by $0.7B to $23.1B in Q2, driven mainly by free cash flow of $1.0B, partially offset by other financing activities, including debt repayments
• We are planning to grow production as quickly as possible in alignment with the 50% CAGR target we began guiding to in early 2021. In some years we may grow faster and some we may grow slower, depending on a number of factors. For 2023, we expect to remain ahead of the long-term 50% CAGR with around 1.8 million vehicles for the year.
• We have ample liquidity to fund our product roadmap, long-term capacity expansion plans and other expenses. Furthermore, we will manage the business such that we maintain a strong balance sheet during this uncertain period.
• While we continue to execute on innovations to reduce the cost of manufacturing and operations, over time, we expect our hardware-related profits to be accompanied by an acceleration of AI, software and fleet-based profits.
• Cybertruck remains on track to begin initial production later this year at Gigafactory Texas. In addition, we continue to make progress on our next generation platform.

Some interesting stories of note from Tesla's Q2 2023 earnings release:
