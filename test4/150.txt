CHICAGO, MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, May 11, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax™ announced the launch today of the YieldMax™ NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSE Arca: NVDY), which seeks to generate monthly income via a synthetic covered call strategy on NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA). NVDY is actively managed by ZEGA Financial. The fund does not invest directly in NVDA.

NVDY is the latest member of the YieldMax™ family and like all YieldMax™ ETFs, aims to deliver substantial monthly income to investors. NVDY joins existing YieldMax™ ETFs, TSLY, OARK and APLY, whose current yield information is provided in the table below:

* APLY’s inception date was April 17, 2023. APLY’s distribution is $0.00 due to the limited amount of time elapsed since its inception.

2. The Current Yield is the annual yield an investor would receive if the most recently declared distribution, which includes option income, remained the same going forward. The Current Yield is calculated by multiplying such distribution by twelve (12), and dividing the resulting amount by the ETF’s most recent NAV. The Current Yield represents a single distribution from the ETF and does not represent its total return.

3. The 30-Day SEC Yield for TSLY is 4.14%, the 30-Day SEC Yield for OARK is 3.30% and the 30-Day SEC Yield for APLY is 0.00%. The 30-Day SEC Yield represents net investment income, which excludes option income, earned by such ETF over the 30-Day period ended April 30th, 2023, expressed as an annual percentage rate based on such ETF’s share price at the end of the 30-Day period.

The performance data quoted above represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost and current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted above.
