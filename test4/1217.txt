A recent controversial tweet has landed Elon Musk in hot water, with demands for his resignation coming from Facebook co-founder and Asana CEO, Dustin Moskovitz.

What Happened: As Business Insider reported on Wednesday, the controversy ignited when Musk endorsed an antisemitic post on X, referring to it as the “actual truth.” This led to Moskovitz calling for Musk’s resignation from all his roles, including his position as CEO of Tesla Inc. TSLA.

The post Musk endorsed perpetuates the “great replacement theory,” a widely debunked theory often used against Jewish supporters of immigration. The swift backlash to Musk’s comment included Tesla investor Ross Gerber’s announcement to switch his Model Y for a Rivian.

Musk later defended his comments, expressing his frustration with what he perceives as “de facto anti-white racism.” His promotion of hate and antisemitism was criticized by public figures such as CNN anchor Jake Tapper and tech journalist Kara Swisher.

Why It Matters: Moskovitz’s recent call for Musk’s resignation echoes these previous criticisms of the entrepreneur.

This incident is not Musk’s first brush with controversy on X. He previously took issue with the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) over allegations of antisemitism on his platform, as noted in a Benzinga article from September.

Moreover, Musk’s views on free speech have been called into question. As reported by Benzinga in March 2022, Musk declared himself a “free speech absolutist,” refusing to block certain news sources on his Starlink platform. This stance is now under scrutiny following his recent endorsement of the antisemitic post.

Earlier in September 2023, Mary Trump, the niece of ex-president Donald Trump, criticized Musk’s influence on X and labeled him an “anti-Semitic fascist” as per a Benzinga report.
