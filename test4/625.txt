Months after alleged videos and photos of Tesla Inc.‘s TSLA Cybertruck getting stuck in the mud surfaced on social media, yet another alleged sighting of the electric pickup truck found stranded on the side of the road has been reported.

What Happened: In the latest episode of the ongoing Cybertruck testing saga, an observant passerby spotted what appeared to be a Cybertruck release candidate on the side of the road adjacent to the Interstate 280 El Monte exit in Los Altos Hills.

According to the witness, a Tesla employee was seen working under the vehicle’s hood, presumably addressing some unforeseen issue.

However, before they could investigate, the employee covered the Cybertruck and left the scene, strongly suggesting that an unexpected breakdown had occurred.

Instances like this might raise concerns among enthusiasts and critics alike, but they are expected during the rigorous testing phase of new vehicles. The grueling testing process is designed to push vehicles to their limits, uncover weaknesses, and ensure that any potential issues are identified and addressed before reaching customers’ hands, according to Electrek.

Why It’s Important: Tesla CEO Elon Musk previously said the Cybertruck could function as an off-road vehicle. He also indicated that adjustments were being made to the vehicle’s air suspension system.

Even with the initial deliveries edging closer, Tesla has maintained a level of secrecy regarding the details of the Cybertruck Although, the company has hinted that it would be distinguished as “the first sub-19 ft pickup truck with four doors and a bed over six feet.”

Earlier this month, a rare picture of the Cybertruck parked beside a Rivian R1T provided some insights into its size.
