It has been years since Elon Musk made the initial announcement of the Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) Cybertruck – a new off-road, armored, and bulletproof electric vehicle (EV).

While the initially expected launch date near the tail end of September came and went, it has been confirmed since late October that the long-awaited delivery event will take place on November 30.

Considering the interest and excitement generated by the Cybertruck – and the likely impact it could have on the value of Tesla’s shares – Finbold decided to consult with OpenAI’s advanced artificial intelligence (AI) platform, ChatGPT, on how things might pan out.

ChatGPT proved highly evasive and very cautious when assessing a possible price for Tesla’s stock upon the launch of the Cybertuck. Interestingly, as much as it had taken into account the excitement about the new vehicle, it determined it to be a double-edged sword.

Indeed, Tesla’s leadership – including Elon Musk himself – has already called on investors to temper their expectations. A major reason for this is that despite Tesla having the capacity to manufacture about 125,000 Cybertucks annually, there is some skepticism about how quickly the company can achieve the said pace of production.

Additionally, it is possible that as few as 10 vehicles will be handed over to their new owners at the delivery event at the gigafactory in Austin, Texas, on November 30. Such an outcome could shock many investors, considering there are currently approximately 2 million Cybertruck reservation holders.

Ultimately, ChatGPT placed TSLA stock in the range between $200 and $250. This indicates that the AI assesses that the launch will either have little to no impact on the price in the short term or might even backfire on the company due to the hype, considering its value is standing at $241.05 at the time of publication.

No matter how the launch event itself goes for Tesla’s shares, its performance on the stock market so far in 2023 is nothing short of impressive – especially considering the slowdown in the demand for EVs. Since January 1, TSLA is up 122.81%.

It has also managed to rise 13.57% over the previous 30 days despite its latest earnings report, published in mid-October, being widely considered to be disappointing.

No matter the short-term effects the launch of the Cybertuck might have, Tesla’s future looks rather promising.

The EV giant has managed to increase its annual vehicle deliveries continuously, looks poised to expand into the Indian market, is reportedly planning to start producing new models that are to cost only $28,000, and already has 2 million Cybertucks reservations to fulfill over time.
