Major U.S. equities indexes moved lower as the rally that lifted the S&P 500 and the Dow to record highs lost momentum Monday.

The negative performance came at the top of a trading week that will feature President Joe Biden's State of the Union Address, testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, and the release of the latest jobs data.

The S&P 500 fell 0.1% on the day. The Dow was down 0.3%, while the Nasdaq slipped 0.4%.

Tesla (TSLA) shares posted Monday's weakest performance on the S&P 500, tumbling 7.2% after data revealed a year-over-year slowdown in the electric vehicle (EV) maker's sales in China during February. While the Lunar New Year holiday in China may have crimped car sales during the month, Tesla also faces increasing competition from rivals based in the country.

Shares of Albemarle (ALB), the world's largest lithium producer, fell 6.7%. The downturn marks a reversal from the last month in which the stock price grew more than 20%. Analysts have noted that, while Albemarle remains on track to benefit from long-term demand for EVs and renewable energy storage solutions, it faces an uncertain trajectory in the near term.



News emerged last week that merger talks between entertainment giants Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and Paramount Global (PARA) had come to an end. This week, an analyst at Macquarie raised concerns about the television business, which is an essential component of both companies. Shares of Warner Bros. dropped 6.5% on Monday, while Paramount shares were down 5.9%.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) was Monday's top stock on the S&P 500, popping 10.2% higher amid optimism about artificial intelligence (AI) opportunities. The IT company released a mixed earnings report last week, beating quarterly profit forecasts but reporting lower-than-expected revenue amid soft demand for its networking products.



Newmont Corp. (NEM), the world's largest gold producer, announced a private offering of senior unsecured notes. The company plans to use the proceeds from the notes to refinance existing debts, including those related to last year's acquisition of Australia-based Newcrest Mining. An uptick in gold prices also helped underpin Newmont shares, which were up 5.7% on the day.

Shares of Dominion Energy (D) added 4.3%, recovering a portion of the losses posted Friday after issuing lower-than-expected profit guidance. Dominion CEO Robert M. Blue recently purchased nearly $1 million worth of the company's stock, suggesting a high level of confidence in the utility's upcoming performance.
