Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District executive director Alberto Ayala told The Sacramento Bee that the district paid for the 18 semi trucks with $4.5 million in grants.

Given that the cost of a Tesla Semi is around $250,000, grants are needed to encourage companies to buy zero-emission vehicles, Ayala said, as reported by the Sacramento-based daily.

Tesla launched the semi-truck in 2017. During the launch, Tesla pegged the price of the 500-mile version of the truck at $180,000 and the 300-mile range version at $150,000. The price paid by PepsiCo is roughly 40% higher than the price initially announced for the higher-range version of the much-awaited semi-truck.

PepsiCo received a total of 36 Tesla Semis from December last year, deployed in parts in Modesto and Sacramento.
