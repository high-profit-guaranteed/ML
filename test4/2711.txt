In this piece, we will take a look at the 25 largest automotive companies and suppliers in the world. If you want to skip our overview of the global automotive industry, then you can take a look at the 5 Largest Automotive Companies and Suppliers in the World.

The global automotive industry is one of the largest in the world, having grown in size after the first mass produced automobiles were offered by Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) and Rolls-Royce Holdings plc (OTC:RYCEY). Since then, cars have become significantly more advanced, and in the 21st century, they're also facing stiff competition from next generation vehicles that use electricity and aim to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.

Its size and tight link with the economy also means that the automotive industry often ends up acting as one of the barometers for economic health. This is because large manufacturers like Ford and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) employ thousands of people in their factories. These workers are dependent on car sales, and if the economy is growing and people can buy more cars, the workers are able to keep a job and vice versa.

However, the industry is facing some turbulence. Right now, interest rates in the U.S. are at extremely high levels which do not suit either businesses or consumers. Consequently, electric vehicle stocks are under pressure, making some wonder whether this is the perfect opportunity to position a portfolio for long term growth.

So, how bad are things for EV automotive stocks? Well, we can check this by analyzing the performance of S&P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)'s S&P U.S. & China Electric Vehicle Index and S&P Kensho Electric Vehicles Index. These two automotive stock indexes are down by 4.45% and 7.49% over the past twelve months, and their year to date performance is also in the red. This poor performance is also reflected in electric vehicle stocks such as Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) which are down by 27.61% and 44.54% year to date, respectively.

The next thing to consider is to check whether the turmoil in the EV industry is also presence in the broader automotive sector and to what extent. Continuing with our brief analysis of stock indexes, two such indexes that cover automotive stocks are the Dow Jones U.S. Automobiles Index and S&P 500 Automobiles (Industry). Well, the former is down by 40% over the year while the latter is down by 25% over the same time period.

On the news side of things, the automotive industry is bracing for yet another shock as we exit the first quarter of 2024. After the well known coronavirus lock downs that placed Tesla's Elon Musk against California authorities, this time around, it's the Francis Scott Key Bridge's collapse in Baltimore. The bridge's collapse led to the Port of Baltimore suspending shipping, with statements from General Motors and Ford sharing that they would have to divert shipments that were initially directed to the port.

Finally, as investors continue to hope for interest rate cuts in 2024, here's what Diamond Hill Capital had to say about General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) in its third quarter of 2023 investor letter:
