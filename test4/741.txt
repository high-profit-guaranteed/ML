Tesla Inc.â€™s China deliveries surged last month as the electric-vehicle maker cut prices and rolled out the long-anticipated revamped Model 3.

The carmaker, headed by Elon Musk , delivered 84,159 vehicles from its Shanghai plant in August, according to preliminary data from the China Passenger Car Association. The numbers represent a 31% jump from July and a 9.3% increase from a year earlier.
