Tesla Inc. ’s German workers gave the union IG Metall the most seats in a contested election for the council that represents workers at the EV maker’s factory outside Berlin. The labor group fell short of winning an outright majority.

IG Metall, one of Germany’s largest unions, won 39% of the vote, meaning it will probably get 16 of the available 39 seats on the board, it said late Wednesday. Failing to reach a majority means it will need to partner with another group to push for improved working conditions.
