With global supply chain strains easing and technological advancements unfolding the automotive industry is exhaling a sigh of relief. However, not all companies stand to gain equally. Considering this, it could be judicious to wait for a more favorable entry point in Ford Motor Company (F).

Meanwhile, it seems prudent to steer clear of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) owing to its bleak fundamentals. Before delving into the featured stocks, let’s first explore the current dynamics of the automotive sector.

Last year, the auto industry witnessed a resounding surge in vigor, with numerous companies achieving double-digit sales growth. Stability, once elusive in a sector marred by pandemic-induced turbulence, reemerged. S&P Global Mobility forecasted that global light vehicle sales for 2023 surged to nearly 86 million units, registering an 8.9% uptick from 2022.

The ongoing rebound in light vehicle production is facilitating inventory replenishment as both supply chains and demand continue to recover. This trend is being bolstered by enduring pent-up consumer demand across various regions. Global new light vehicle sales are anticipated to witness a 2.8% year-over-year increase this year.

Concurrently, the momentum toward electrification is intensifying, heralding the beginning of the electric vehicle revolution. Currently, four out of ten Americans are contemplating an EV for their next vehicle purchase. This is because anticipated advancements in battery technology offer the potential for enhanced EV range and efficiency.

Moreover, vehicles are evolving into sophisticated connectivity hubs, incorporating advanced infotainment systems, vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and seamless integration with smart devices as standard features. The focus on enhanced connectivity and Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities is further revolutionizing the driving experience.

In light of these trends, let’s look at the fundamentals of the two Auto & Vehicle Manufacturers stocks.
