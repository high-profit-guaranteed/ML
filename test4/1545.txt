The economy of the United States is deeply linked to the stock market of the country. Both the economy and the stock market have battled recession fears over the past few months, leading to a slowdown in the economy and increased volatility at the market. However, as interest rates stabilize, inflation cools, and growth picks up again, there is increased optimism around a soft landing for the US economy, leading to the emergence of a bull market on Wall Street. The benchmark S&P 500 is close to hitting a record high and up is over 24% so far this year.

One particular trend that investors should keep in mind before investing in stocks is that over the past few months, even though the threat of a market crash loomed large over the US economy, companies like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), and Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) continued to outperform peers, generating record revenues and ratcheting up impressive growth numbers. This duality has led to increased volatility that shrewd investors can take advantage of before the economy normalizes again.

The story of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is particularly compelling in this regard. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, one of the most popular and volatile on the market, has returned more than 129% to investors this year, and is up over an astonishing 1,073% in the past five years. The company remains on track to deliver record vehicles this year, although analysts expect it to fall short of the 2 million annual delivery target. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has leveraged industry-leading margins to slash prices of cars to achieve these targets.

According to a report by news agency Reuters, the California-based EV maker delivered 1.82 million vehicles globally in 2023, up 37% from 2022, with about 473,000 units in the fourth quarter. However, per owner Elon Musk, high borrowing costs led to demand pressures that slowed down deliveries. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) aims to achieve a growth rate of over 50% annually. As other EV makers roll back electrification plans due to slowing demand, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is ramping them up.

Vaibhav Taneja, the CFO of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), talked about some of these plans alongside Elon Musk during the third quarter earnings call. Taneja noted that this year, the firm had generated operating cash flows of approximately $8.9 billion and free cash flows of approximately $2.3 billion. He added that other businesses of the firm were becoming more prominent on a stand-alone basis with the energy business leading the charge primarily from the growth in megabyte deployments.

“Vehicle deliveries in Q3 outpaced production, and we had yet another record quarter of profitability in our Energy business. Congratulations to the Tesla team for their continued focus on operational excellence as we navigate through a period of economic uncertainty, higher interest rates, and shifting consumer sentiment. As Elon mentioned, our Q3 operational and financial performance was impacted by planned downturns for our factory upgrades. This was necessary to allow for further factory improvements and production rate increases. Despite those factory shutdowns, our cost per vehicle decreased to approximately $37,500. We saw sequential decreases in material costs and freight. Reducing the cost of our vehicles is our top priority. On the operating expenses front, R&D expenses continue to rise due to Cybertruck prototype builds and pilot production testing combined with spend on AI technologies like full self-driving Optimus and Dojo. We have and will continue to make investments in these areas and hence, our capital expenditure and R&D will continue to grow in the near term. However, our focus is to continue making investments through positive cash flow from operations. This year itself we have generated operating cash flows of approximately $8.9 billion and free cash flows of approximately $2.3 billion.”

The companies that have a beta of greater than 2 were shortlisted. Those with market capitalizations of more than $1 billion were then selected and ranked according to hedge fund sentiment. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2023 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.

That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.
