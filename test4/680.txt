Tesla Inc TSLA CEO Elon Musk on Saturday shed light on the more difficult aspects of developing its humanoid bot Optimus.

What Happened: “The hardware is actually extremely difficult,” Musk wrote on X.com, formerly Twitter. The CEO was responding to a user who wrote that the Tesla Optimus Robot is not so much about hardware as it is about full self-driving.

The user termed the bot a ‘future money-making machine’ and added, “The total addressable market for Optimus is mind-blogging.”

Why It Matters: Tesla announced the humanoid Optimus two years ago and has made about 10 of them so far.

During the company’s second-quarter earnings call last month, Musk said that the first Optimus bot that will have all the Tesla-designed actuators integrated and walking will be ready by around November. No supplier produces the actuators required for the bot, leaving Tesla to design its own, he said.

"The first Optimus that is — that will have all of the Tesla designed actuators, sort of production candidate actuators integrated and walking should be around November-ish," Musk said.

Sometime next year, the bots will be able to do something useful in Tesla factories, the CEO then said while adding that he is ‘pretty confident' about it.
