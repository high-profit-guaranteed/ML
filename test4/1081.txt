Tesla Inc. was subject to a walkout at seven of its repair shops in Sweden after members of the IF Metall union were called to strike.

“Tesla is a global leader in the green transition. We hope that they will be willing to express the same level of leadership regarding working conditions for their employees and our members,” the industrial workers’ union said in a statement.
