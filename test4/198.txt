It was not that long ago when Tesla viewed advertisements with a haughty disdain worthy of a Creole aristocrat. However, in the face of a sustained demand slump and the attendant production-related exigencies, the EV giant appears to have finally capitulated.

Elon Musk laid prepared the ground for Tesla adverts in last week's annual meeting of the shareholders by declaring that "Tesla will start advertising a little."

Today, we got the first glimpse of this sea change in Tesla's strategy when a two-minute advertisement appeared on Twitter Asia. At the time of writing, the ad has been viewed by 467,000 people, which is nearly three times the number of followers that Tesla Asia – an official subsidiary that posted the advert on Twitter – can boast of.

Of course, it remains to be seen whether today's move constitutes merely the first drop in the proverbial bucket or simply an aberrant development.

Nonetheless, the company continues to suffer not only from demand-related malaise but also tarnished brand image. Consider the fact that Tesla lost 50 places in this year's Axios Harris Poll of 100 brands, managing to grab only the 62nd place in the just-published ranking.

Meanwhile, as we noted in a previous post, Tesla's Q1 2023 earnings were the worst in the past 15 quarters.

The company's quarterly revenue fell by around 7 percent on a sequential basis, spurred by a widespread price cut of between 12 and 15 percent during Q1.

The situation for Tesla in China remains in a state of flux. The company delivered 10,200 units in China in the week ending on the 21st of May, constituting an increase of 2.10 percent from the previous week.

Tesla is likely to record its best performance ever in China for the month of May.

However, storm clouds continue to persist, as explained in the tweet above. Given the steep discounts in China, the company barely makes any money on the Model 3 and Model Y sales. This is likely to keep pressurizing Tesla's margins.

Against this backdrop, mass advertisements remain the most convenient option for the EV giant to spur additional sales.
