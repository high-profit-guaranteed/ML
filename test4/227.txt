ETF issuer GraniteShares has announced that it will close one of its single-stock leveraged ETFs tied to American electric vehicle maker Tesla, the GraniteShares 1x Short TSLA Daily ETF (NASDAQ:TSLI). The ETF did not last long, as it was only launched last year.

When it was launched, the GraniteShares 1x Short TSLA Daily ETF aimed to offer investors a 1X short stance against the EV maker. The bearish ETF was launched alongside two other leveraged single-stock exchange traded funds. The other two were long Coinbase and Apple.

In a news release at the time, GraniteShares founder and CEO Will Rhind stated that the launch of the new ETFs provided more choices to investors. It also allowed investors to take high-conviction positions on specific stocks.

“Product innovations like these give more choice to investors, who, thanks to their ability to access stock markets, data, and company news in real time, are better informed than ever before. We believe many of these technology-empowered investors are looking for new ways to take advantage of market opportunities,” Rhind said at the time.

Yet as per a recent announcement, GraniteShares has opted to close and liquidate its TSLA short ETF. In an announcement about the change, the firm noted that the GraniteShares board approved the liquidation and closure of the GraniteShares 1x Short TSLA Daily ETF on May 19, 2023. With this in mind, the last day of trading for the outgoing ETF on the NASDAQ Stock Market would be on June 16, 2023.

“The last day creation orders will be accepted for the ETF will be June 14, 2023. Investors may sell their shares of the ETF until market close on June 16, 2023. Shares of the ETF will no longer trade on NASDAQ Stock Market after market close on June 16, 2023, and will be subsequently delisted. The final distribution to shareholders of the ETF is expected to occur on or about June 19, 2023,” GraniteShares wrote.

It should be noted that GraniteShares is not only focused on a bearish stance against Tesla. The firm also offers a dedicated ETF for a long TSLA position, the GraniteShares 1.25x Long TSLA Daily ETF. The GraniteShares 1.25x Long TSLA Daily ETF will outlive its short counterpart.
