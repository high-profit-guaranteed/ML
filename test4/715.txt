The Cybertruck frenzy has gotten wilder as the launch of Tesla, Inc.'s TSLA much-awaited electric pickup truck draws closer.

Cybertruck Timeline: Elon Musk unveiled the Cybertruck’s unique trapezoid design on Nov. 21, 2019, introducing three models: a single-motor, rear-wheel drive base variant, a dual-motor all-wheel drive version, and a trimotor AWD variant.

Production timelines targeted late 2021 for the more affordable models and 2022 for the trimotor. Ranging from 250 to 500 miles, the Cybertruck’s distance capacity varied by model.

Initially priced at $39,900, the Cybertruck’s journey faced challenges with the COVID-19 pandemic, production hitches, and supply chain constraints. During this period, Rivian‘s R1T EV pickup and Ford‘s F-150 Lightning made their own market entries.

Tesla temporarily shifted focus, launching its heavy-duty Semi EV truck in late 2022. However, Musk confirmed the Cybertruck’s return in February 2023, promising availability later in the year and deliveries by Q3’s end.

Tesla showcased the first production Cybertruck from Giga Texas in July. Enthusiasts captured sightings on social media, including Musk’s own drives in Austin.

Tesla Returns Since Cybertruck Announcement: Tesla began taking preorders for the Cybertruck since the first announcement in late 2019. Potential customers were allowed to place reservations by making a $100 refundable deposit.

Since then, Cybertruck reservations have swelled to nearly two million, according to crowd-sourced tracking data.

If a Cybertruck fan, instead of paying $100 for a reservation, had invested the amount in Tesla stock, he would have about 4.33 shares. The same shares would be worth $1,086.98, returning roughly 990% in about four years, instead of lying idly in Tesla's coffers.

In the same period, the S&P 500 returned roughly 45%.

That said, analysts are upbeat about the Cybetruck. Future Fund’s Gary Black expects the launch to triple the company’s stock by 2030 and have a halo effect on the sales of Tesla’s other EVs.

In premarket trading, Tesla stock fell 0.50% to $255.90, according to Benzinga Pro data.
