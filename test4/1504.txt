Tech has been the talk of Wall Street in 2023 as the Magnificent Seven - Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA), hold almost 30% of the value of the S&P 500 (^GSPC). But could that change in 2024? Washington Crossing Advisors Senior Portfolio Manager Chad Morganlander joins Yahoo Finance for the latest edition of Good Buy or Goodbye where he provides insight for investing in the tech sector heading into 2024.

The stock Morganlander argues is a good buy is Accenture (ACN). Morganlander says Accenture will benefit from other companies investing in AI and tech advancements that will need their services. Morganlander also claims the company has increased in bookings and revenue growth and points to long-term growth for the company going forward. Overall, Morganlander says the stock is "an easy way of playing the cloud, artificial intelligence, as well as data security in one company."

The stock Morganlander is avoiding is Tesla. The EV maker has had a turbulent 2023 with recalls, product delays, and problematic leadership. Morganlander claims the reasons to avoid this stock are the current valuation is too high, growing competition will put pressure on the company, and vulnerable to unexpected slowdowns with consumers.

JULIE HYMAN: It's a big noisy universe of stocks out there. Welcome to "Good Buy or Goodbye," brought to you by E-trade from Morgan Stanley, our goal to help cut through that noise to navigate the best moves for your portfolio. Today we're looking at the tech space broadly. And joining me now, Chad Morganlander, Washington Crossing advisors, senior portfolio manager. Chad and I have known each other for a long time. So it's great to welcome you here to talk about this.

CHAD MORGANLANDER: Thanks for having me, Julie.

JULIE HYMAN: I appreciate it. So let's talk about your good buy stock, first of all. And that is Accenture. And it's interesting, first of all, because I don't think of Accenture off the bat as a tech stock, right? But it has increasingly become so.

CHAD MORGANLANDER: Absolutely. It's a consulting company that focuses primarily on technology spending. And they do roughly about $66 billion in revenues. And it has a market cap of about $220 billion. Over the last several years, I've listened to hundreds of publicly traded companies talk about where they're going with their investment spending. And last year, it was cloud. And of course, 2023, every other line is about artificial intelligence.

CHAD MORGANLANDER: Now, they have to put the money where their mouth is and spend it in regard to laying out capital investment. Accenture, we believe, will be at the tailwind of this and be able to benefit over the next 3, 5, 7, and 10 years. We could be at the beginning stages like similar to the early '90s, where business investment is going to be focused primarily on artificial intelligence and worker productivity.

JULIE HYMAN: Gotcha. And they'll look to Accenture say to get that kind of advice. Also, when we're looking at bookings and revenue growth from what we have been seeing from the company, you're encouraged by that also.

CHAD MORGANLANDER: Well, it increased to about 12%. And what one has to notice here is that there isn't a large amount of expectations management has provided over the next year or so, roughly about revenues of 5% or 4%, of which 2% of that is through acquisition. So any real organic growth that will kick higher and a good tailwind for that over the next 3 to 5 years really could bode well for this stock in the long run.

Also, operating margins over the last five years have continued to increase in a gradual manner of 30 to 50 basis points. We've owned this stock for over 7 years. And we expect to own it for the next 5 years.

JULIE HYMAN: Gotcha. So you expect this to continue to lift the stock and over the longer term.

CHAD MORGANLANDER: It's an easy way of playing the cloud, artificial intelligence, as well as data security in one company and not have to overpay when it comes to buying a pure play artificial intelligence company. You could win by owning the whole ecosystem and benefiting from that.

JULIE HYMAN: Right. To your point, the PEs on a lot of those pure plays are very high right now. So we like to ask people what could go wrong here. And you're saying in 2024, we could potentially see tech spending take a hit.

CHAD MORGANLANDER: Julie, it's all about capital investment, technology investment. And if the economy starts to decelerate or there's a credit dislocation, then this company will be susceptible to that in the short run. But we believe if you own it for the long run that a publicly traded company can't hire the infrastructure and make it cost-efficient. They will have to go outside in order to hire expertise to help them with not only the cloud but artificial intelligence and data security.

Look no further as Clorox. Clorox had a breach in regard to data. It ruins their revenue growth and operating margin growth for 2023. It was preventable.

JULIE HYMAN: Right. So there's appetite for this kind of stuff. And again, as you mentioned, disclosure wise, the firm owns it, but you do not own it personally.

JULIE HYMAN: OK. So let's get to your goodbye, the one that you do not prefer right now. And that is Tesla interestingly enough. Now this not the first time that we've talked about Tesla actually is a goodbye for someone. So let's run through your case on this one. First up, the valuation, not attractive right now you think.

CHAD MORGANLANDER: $800 billion market cap, next year they should do revenues of about $120 billion with operating margins of about 11%, 12%. A lot of that operating margin has to do with carbon credits and whatnot. We believe also that there has been great amount of tailwind benefit from, of course, some of the benefits that consumers get from a tax break to buy these cars. And the European Union is going to perhaps curtail that.

They also have, I think, it's priced as if there's no competition. And of course, wouldn't one know there's a little Chinese company named BYD that seems to be giving them a run for their money in China. They're going to be moving more onto the emerging markets. I just believe that competition will sap from potential revenue growth in year 3, 4 and 5.

Of course, a wonderful company, seems like everyone wants it. But it doesn't also have the profit margin profile of an Apple, of a Google, but yet it's trading at a revenue multiple that's substantially higher.

JULIE HYMAN: And so if it is trading at that kind of multiple, perhaps 0.3 here, leaves it vulnerable to some kind of unexpected slowdown, if it is pricing at that relatively high level.

CHAD MORGANLANDER: Right. So what you're looking at there is a consumer slowdown for big ticket items. We're not in the middle of that. But yet if that comes to fruition in 2024 into 2025, this company is an auto company, its revenues are going to react similar to the other auto companies. So the valuation for Mercedes Benz is trading at around 1 times EV to sales. You have Ford and General Motors, we know that they are still stuck in the mud. Regardless, their valuations are substantially higher. Tesla is trading in EV to sales roughly about 8 times.

JULIE HYMAN: Right. Enterprise value to sales talking about there. OK. So just like we looked at what could go wrong for Accenture, what could go right when it comes to Tesla that would make this thesis incorrect? Profit margins, talk to me about that.

CHAD MORGANLANDER: Profit margins, the transition perhaps to autonomous driving, perhaps the margin for software selling would be substantially higher. Who knows what will come out of Tesla from that perspective? But I just don't believe that they can get a margin of 20%, where General Motors and Ford has a margin of 4%, 5%, 6%. And Mercedes has a margin of 11%. It's really hard to squeeze water out of a rock.

JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. And, of course, we don't know the timing of the fuller autonomous driving capabilities, because the company has a tendency to push things back.

CHAD MORGANLANDER: Absolutely. And that could be somewhat of a concern in regard to valuation. So we think that this one is one that one wants to sidestep for this moment. We want to go with something a little bit more attractive that's growing profitable, well capitalized, with very little debt, that may be a consistent steady-eddy with a very low type of expectations. And that's Accenture.

JULIE HYMAN: And positioning wise, out of Tesla, short Tesla, what are you guys in terms of that?

CHAD MORGANLANDER: We would avoid Tesla altogether. It's not even in our universe. It just-- it doesn't share the profile that we're looking for, which is real steady-eddy type of growth. And now you've got this tailwind behind you regarding artificial intelligence and cloud computing.

JULIE HYMAN: All right. So let's sum up what we have talked about, shall we? The buy's Accenture. Your buy's Accenture. You see the business investment being a positive tailwind here. Bookings gaining momentum, revenue growth surprising to the upside in the new year, and profit margins increasing. Your avoid stock, Tesla. You see valuation as an issue when it comes to competition. Entering the space, you're also seeing the stock vulnerable to unexpected slowdowns.
