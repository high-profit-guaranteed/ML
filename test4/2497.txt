In June 2022, inflation in the US reached its highest point in four decades but subsequently decreased by December 2023. This decline can be attributed to actions such as the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates, improvements in supply chain efficiency, and a reduction in gasoline prices. However, despite the drop in inflation, it remains significantly high compared to pre-pandemic levels. The overall inflation rate in the US as of February 2024 stood at 3.2%, up from 3.1% in January. While inflation has decreased from its peak of 9.1% in 2022, it remains significantly higher than the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. This situation has led to financial difficulties for many Americans.

Comparing prices in December 2023 to those in January 2020 reveals a significant increase, with overall prices rising by 19%, food prices by 25%, energy prices by 26%, and shelter service prices by 21%. Meanwhile, wages for workers in private industries saw a rise of 4.3% by December 2023, compared to 5.1% in December 2022. Furthermore, US employers are planning to increase salaries by an average of 4.0% in 2024. This is slightly lower than the 4.4% increase in 2023 but still higher than the 3.1% increase seen in previous years. In 2023, pay raises outpaced inflation for the first time since 2020, highlighting a more stable job market compared to the period from 2008 to 2020.

In January 2024, the unemployment rate remained stable at 3.7% for the past three months, marking a decrease from January 2021, when it stood at 6.4%. However, despite these positive signs in the job market, the high inflation rate has continued to impact major companies like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). In October 2023, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), voiced concerns about the effects of increased interest rates, stating that they offset the benefits of Tesla's price reductions and lower people's ability to purchase cars. Additionally, the higher interest rates and global economic uncertainties have impacted Tesla's plans to expand its factory in Mexico.
