The launch of Tesla, Inc.‘s TSLA Cybertruck is long overdue and the latest updates from the company and CEO Elon Musk suggest the electric pickup truck could commercially launch anytime soon.

What Happened: Tesla’s official X handle shared a livestreaming of an off-road Cybertruck in Baja California, which is a state in northwest Mexico. The livestreaming was done via Musk-owned SpaceX unit Starlink’s satellite service.

Musk also posted the video on his handle on X, formerly Twitter.

Mexico is key in Tesla’s scheme of things as the company is setting up its sixth Gigafactory south of the Texas border in the Mexican state of Nuevo León.

Baja is situated on a peninsula that separates the Pacific Ocean from the Gulf of California and the peninsula has four major desert areas. The voiceover for the live stream said the track is one of the most challenging routes in the world.

Commenting on the video, a Tesla influencer pointed out that he called out Baja testing in March.

Why It’s Important: The Cybertruck was spotted earlier this year in New Zealand where it underwent winter testing. The newest EV from Tesla’s stable is expected to lift the company’s volume growth, which is the need of the hour as the company’s recent price cuts have proved inelastic and have not done much good for volume.

Tesla closed Friday’s session up 0.18% at $260.53, according to Benzinga Pro data.
