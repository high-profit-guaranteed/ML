While Tesla’s steep sell-off Thursday likely concerned bullish traders, the downturn hasn’t been enough, so far, to negate the stock's uptrend. The downturn was also taking place on lower-than-average volume, which suggests the bulls remain in control.

The Tesla Chart: Tesla was working to print a bearish kicker candlestick on Thursday, which suggests lower prices could come again on Friday. If Tesla continues to move lower on decreasing volume, the stock is likely to print a bullish reversal candlestick, such as a doji or hammer candlestick, over the next few days, which could signal a reversal to the upside.
• Tesla left a gap above between $280.93 and $289.52. Gaps on charts are about 90% likely to fill in the future and when Tesla rebounds to fill the gap, the stock may find at least temporary resistance at the top of the empty trading range.
• If Tesla finds support at $265.10 and bounces up from that area, the stock will form a triple bottom pattern, when paired with similar price action at that level on July 10 and July 11. If the stock falls under that area, Tesla’s uptrend will be negated and a downtrend could be in the works.
• Tesla has resistance above at $271.71 and $285.83 and support below at $265.10 and $254.98.
