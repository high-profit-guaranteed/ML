Tesla (TSLA) is set to unveil its long-awaited Cybertruck EV on Thursday, November 30. While many automakers integrate Tesla's charging technology, questions are rising about the competition with Tesla in the EV landscape.

General Motors (GM) CEO Mary Barra sat down with Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi and weighed in on EV competition, reassuring investors and consumers that GM has the competitive edge and how its portfolio of EVs leaves little to worry about.

"When I look at our truck portfolio, and where we stand with trucks today, and the capability of those trucks and what customers really care about, I'm confident that we've got a winning strategy from a truck perspective in the EV market," Barra states.

- Mentioned Tesla. They have a big day coming tomorrow. They're rolling out a square box type SUV. I don't know how, other way to put it. Is that Cybertruck-- do you see that as a competitor, a true competitor to the Silverado or a truck that you make?

MARY BARRA: Well, you know, I think when we look at our truck portfolio from an EV perspective, first of all the Hummer truck is a super truck.

MARY BARRA: It's an incredible vehicle to drive. And again, the radius of turns, et cetera, it's a lot of fun. But then right now we have the Silverado EV work truck out. As we get into next year, we'll have the RST, the more retail version of that along with shortly thereafter, the GMC Sierra EV coming. When I look at our truck portfolio and where we stand with trucks today and the capability of those trucks from what customers really care about, I'm very confident that we've got a winning strategy from a truck perspective in the EV market.

- You don't sound worried about this.

MARY BARRA: Well, I always take every competitor extremely seriously. And so we'll watch as it evolves. But again, I think we know trucks. And when I look at the trucks, the feedback that we're getting from the fleet customers already gives me confidence in our truck portfolio.
