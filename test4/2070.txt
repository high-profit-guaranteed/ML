In this article, we will go over the 20 best electric cars of 2024. If you want to skip our discussion about the EV industry, head over to the 7 Best Electric Cars of 2024.

The global electric vehicle market is growing at an extraordinary rate. It was valued at $384.56 billion in 2022, but it is expected to reach a whopping $1.57 trillion by 2030. The compounding annual growth rate (CAGR) during this forecast period is estimated to be 22.1%. Consumers' preference for environmentally friendly fuel and rising gas prices are two of the key driving factors for this impressive growth rate. It is also worth noting that Asia Pacific is the highest growth region for electric vehicles, and China has the largest market.

It is widely believed that EVs are more environmentally friendly compared to regular vehicles. They are more efficient at utilizing energy and have a significantly lesser carbon footprint. So, governments and organizations, around the world, are attempting to promote electric vehicles. For Instance, On April 12, 2023, the Environment Protection Agency announced a new set of federal vehicle emission standards aimed at speeding the sustainable transportation transition, which will reduce carbon dioxide by 10 billion tons. These standards will also enable the United States to eventually achieve independence from oil. However, despite this, exorbitant prices are discouraging customers from buying electric vehicles. It seems that EV companies are still charging customers the research and development costs that went into developing the technology. For perspective, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s Model X Plaid starts at $119,990.

The good news for consumers is that prices of EVs might drop soon as competition and production process efficiency increase. Interestingly, some technological breakthroughs meant to improve the convenience of electric cars may also help bring the costs down. One such technological advancement is the introduction of solid-state batteries, which may prove to be game changers in the EV industry. These batteries have greater energy storage density, which means that a similar-sized solid-state battery will give more mileage than an ordinary battery. In addition, they also charge much faster, which is a blessing for EV users. Solid-state batteries also have a reduced environmental impact compared to traditional batteries.

Finally, these batteries are also quite cost-effective. A significant portion of the money that users spend on buying an electric vehicle is spent on batteries, so solid-state batteries will help tame the prices in the future. Government incentives for purchasing an electric car, such as the federal government's tax credit of up to $7,500 for new vehicles purchased after 2023, also reduce the cost of owning it.

It is worth noting that solid-state batteries have only recently gone into mass production. Some renowned companies like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) have not yet moved to solid-state technologies. The company has invested heavily in its current battery technology in the form of Gigafactories. These factories are designed to produce lithium-ion batteries at an unprecedented scale. So, shifting to solid-state batteries would require substantial retooling and reengineering of these facilities, which would not only be costly but also time-consuming.

Meanwhile, some companies are focused on producing affordable electric vehicles. One such company is General Motors Company (NYSE:GM). Its Chevrolet Bolt EV is one of the most affordable EVs in the market. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)'s Chevrolet Bolt is also one of the most popular electric vehicles and has an impressive range considering its price. The retail price of this car starts at around $26,500. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)'s Chevrolet Bolt has a 200 hp electric motor and a front-wheel drive.

One of the questions that people ask before buying electric vehicles is this: what is the charging infrastructure like? The answer to this question is that the United States has one of the most extensive charging infrastructures in the world, and it is improving at an unprecedented rate. According to IEA, the United States installed 6,300 fast chargers in 2022. Two-thirds of these were Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s Superchargers. The total stock of these fast chargers reached 28,000 by the year-end 2022. In addition, the Biden-Harris administration announced a plan last year to build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle chargers.

With that backdrop, let's look at some of the best electric cars of 2024.
