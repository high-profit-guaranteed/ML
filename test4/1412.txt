RedMan’s festive campaign via TSLA inspires a baking movement to elevate gift giving

This festive season, The Secret Little Agency seeks to redefine what thoughtful, meaningful gifts should look like in a new campaign for RedMan, the flagship brand of Phoon Huat Pte Ltd. Rooted in the spirit of the season, the campaign aims to encourage Singaporeans to #JustBakeIt, embracing the warmth and sincerity of baked goods as the ultimate gift for anyone. Gifting during the holiday season has long been a source of stress and, at times, an echo of insincere consumerism. RedMan, a brand deeply embedded in Singaporean baking culture, launches its Christmas campaign to shift the narrative. The campaign positions baked goods as not just gifts but as a means to foster deeper connections and authenticity with every bite. “Collaborating hand in hand with The Secret Little Agency sparked a beautiful idea to redefine the essence of giving this Christmas season. Baking becomes a magical act of love, a heartfelt endeavour to spread joy through delightful creations. Delving into the kitchen to craft something from the heart is more than a gesture—it’s a display of genuine care, capable of expressing a myriad of emotions. With this campaign, our aim is to ignite a spark in others, encouraging them to partake in the timeless tradition of crafting handmade bakes as the ultimate personal gift for everyone,” shared Swapnil Shah, Head of Omnichannel, Phoon Huat Pte Ltd. Through a series of witty, cheeky and provocative key visuals, the campaign playfully parodies the visual language of luxury, tech, and electronic appliance brands, designed to make Singaporeans think twice about the value of a gift. Strategically placed along the bustling Orchard Road, these ads find a home in the heart of Singapore’s iconic shopping district in OOH, as well as on social and digital, to catch the crowd going about their holiday shopping.

“We live in an age of mindless consumerism and we wanted to convey the spirit of the campaign in a playful way that is thought-provoking in order to get Singaporeans to rethink their purchasing choices. Ads after ads after ads are created this season telling people to buy more – we wanted to flip this narrative on its head whilst emulating some iconic brand ads, to challenge the collective obsession with shopping and bring back the heartfelt gesture of baking,” said Nicholas Ye and Mavis Neo, Co-Chief Creative Officers, The Secret Little Agency.

Additionally, shoppers can also find @RedManWithSign – a parody of global social personality @DudeWithSign – at iconic spots all along Orchard Road this Saturday (16 December 2023) and The Star Vista this Sunday (17 December 2023), sharing truth bombs on gifting and encouraging shoppers to bake give the gift of thoughtfulness instead. Shoppers can snap a photo of @RedManWithSign to enjoy a discount at RedMan stores with their baking purchases.

To empower shoppers in creating the ultimate thoughtful gift this season, RedMan is offering baking classes and baking kits at its stores. Held on all weekends leading up to Christmas, these classes invite everyone including children to personalize and bake their gifts at selected RedMan stores. Baking kits for popular festive recipes will also be available for purchase, so anyone can easily prepare their gifts at home. Part of a larger strategy, Phoon Huat aims to make baking a quintessential Singaporean pastime. It’s not just about the holidays, it’s a pivotal shift in the brand’s engagement with Singaporeans, to foster a renewed connection to baking as a cherished tradition. The campaign runs until Christmas 2023.
