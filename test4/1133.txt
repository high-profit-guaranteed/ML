Hyderabad: Since October 9, after the Assembly election date was announced and the model code of conduct came into place, the city police have bound over 1,042 rowdy sheeters while 477 were under Special Branch surveillance.

Those in this category are suspects involved in four or more criminal cases and those who are likely to be a threat to the public during the elections.

The police commissioner, mandal revenue officer, revenue divisional officer, and collector are executive magistrates and have powers to bind over the criminals after we identify them as a potential threat to society, said south zone DCP Sai Chaitanya.

Rowdysheeters have to deposit between Rs 50,000 and Rs 1 lakh depending on the seriousness of the crime, Sai Chaitanya said.

The rowdy sheeters are allowed to perform their regular activities including voting in the election but are under constant vigil, the DCP said. If the rowdy sheeters violate the terms, their deposit is forfeited and stern action will be taken against them.
