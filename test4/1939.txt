Elon Musk has said he will shift Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s registration from Delaware to Texas after he claimed a poll on his X/Twitter platform supported the move.

Tesla’s chief executive launched the poll after a Delaware judge blocked his US$56 billion pay package agreed with the electric vehicle (EV) maker in 2018.

Billionaire Musk immediately responded by holding a poll about moving where the company is based.

“Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware,” he said.

“I recommend incorporating in Nevada or Texas if you prefer shareholders to decide matters.”

After the result of the poll, which reportedly found 87% of voters in favour of Tesla changing states, Musk said he would petition shareholders to ratify the shift.

Musk is currently worth nearly $205 billion, including the disputed pay package.
