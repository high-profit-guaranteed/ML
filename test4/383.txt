Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is expected to release its Q2 2023 vehicle delivery and production report this weekend. The expectations of the Street are notable, with Bloomberg’s analyst consensus for the second quarter reaching 448,000 vehicles. Tracked sales estimates from territories like China also hint at potential record numbers this Q2.

Amidst these sentiments, as well as the apparent momentum of the electric vehicle maker, some Tesla bulls have expressed their intention to increase their holdings. These include FSD Beta tester @WholeMarsBlog, who noted that he would be increasing his stake in TSLA in the coming weeks and months. Interestingly enough, the FSD Beta tester’s post caught the eye of Elon Musk, who used his response to advise Tesla shareholders to exercise caution.

“Please advise people to be wary of margin loans. Tesla has always been a high variability stock, often with no obvious rhyme or reason. We are confident about long-term value creation, but cannot control the manic-depressive nature of the stock market,” Musk wrote.

Musk’s rather cautious advice has attracted quite a lot of interest among Tesla supporters online, with some noting that the CEO’s advice could be a prelude to lower-than-expected delivery results in the second quarter. It should be noted, however, that this is not the first time that Musk has cautioned Tesla shareholders about volatility.

Provided that Tesla really does release its Q2 2023 vehicle delivery and production report this weekend, some volatility next week would not be surprising. Even if Tesla were to meet most of the Street’s expectations, after all, skeptics could easily post inflated estimates that would likely be “missed” by the EV maker. And considering that some Tesla skeptics are proficient in affecting the narrative surrounding the company, some volatility in TSLA stock in the days after a quarter’s end has become pretty much expected.

Tesla is expected to report deliveries of about 445,000 vehicles in the second quarter, according to analyst estimates compiled by FactSet. Estimates compiled by Bloomberg suggest that Tesla could deliver up to 448,000 vehicles in Q2, and company-compiled consensus, which include 27 analysts, estimates 446,823 vehicles being delivered in the second quarter.
