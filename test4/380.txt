Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is expected to release its Q2 2023 vehicle delivery and production report this weekend. With this in mind, the Street has posted its estimates for the EV maker’s results, and they are quite optimistic.

Amidst Tesla’s continued ramp in Gigafactory Texas, Berlin, and Shanghai, Wall Street is currently looking for deliveries of about 445,000 vehicles, as per analyst estimates compiled by FactSet. Estimates compiled by Bloomberg suggest that Tesla will be delivering around 448,000 vehicles in the second quarter.

Similar to previous quarters, Tesla has also shared its own company-compiled consensus, which includes 27 analysts that are covering the electric vehicle maker. These analysts represent the following firms:

Baird, Barclays, Bernstein, Bank of America, Canaccord, Citibank, Cowen, Daiwa, Deutsche Bank, Evercore ISI, Exane BNP, Goldman Sachs, Guggenheim, Jefferies, JP Morgan, Mizuho, Morgan Stanley, New Street Research, Oppenheimer, Piper Sandler, RBC, Truist, Tudor, UBS, Wedbush, Wells Fargo, and Wolfe.

The delivery consensus of sell-side analysts as compiled by the EV maker suggests that Tesla would be delivering 446,823 vehicles in the second quarter, comprised of 15,800 Model S and Model X and 430,123 Model 3 and Model Y. At this pace, Tesla may be able to deliver a total of 1,832,049 vehicles in 2023.

The analyst consensus for Tesla’s Q2 2023 results are quite high, though it is feasible considering the demand for the company’s vehicles following a series of price adjustments in key markets like the United States and China. With these price adjustments in place, demand for the company’s best-selling vehicles like the Model Y and Model 3 likely saw some momentum.

That being said, Tesla investors that have long followed the company would probably be wise to expect some volatility once the EV maker releases its Q2 2023 delivery report. Tesla skeptics, after all, tend to post inflated estimates prior to the release of the company’s quarterly results as a way to increase the chances of the EV maker “missing” their expectations. Such skeptics typically get featured in media outlets as well, highlighting the narrative that Tesla’s quarterly results are “disappointing.”
