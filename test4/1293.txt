Tesla (TSLA) released details of the Cybertruck Delivery Event today. The event is scheduled to take place at the company’s Gigafactory in Austin, Texas on Thursday 30th November 2023.

With only 2 days left in the event, Tesla is actively confirming the invitations of the attendees. The last email received by the invited persons asks them to download their unique QR codes using their details. These unique QR codes will allow the Cybertruck Delivery Event attendees to enter the venue with a +1 family or friend.

“Our Cybertruck Delivery Event is just a few days away. Review the details provided and download your unique QR code ticket before you arrive at the event,” the final Cybertruck event invitation email stated.

In this very email, Tesla requests the event visitors to use a ride share to reach the venue because there is a limited parking space available for attendees at Giga Texas.

Tesla published a press release on its Investor Relations website with the details of the Cybertruck Delivery Event date, timings, and live stream information. This presser confirms that Tesla will put out the complete details and specs of the Cybertruck (range, dimensions, features, software, etc.).

A while ago, some Cybertruck specs were leaked but they still need to be validated officially and that is going to finally happen at the triangular-shaped electric pickup truck’s delivery event on Thursday.

As the Cybertruck Delivery Event is getting closer and more and more Cybertrucks are sighted at Giga Texas, the Tesla (TSLA) stock price is increasing. TSLA’s share price increased by $10.64 or 4.51% today alone. A Tesla share was priced at $246.72 at market close today (Tuesday 28th Nov 2023).

According to a Tesla investor Gary Black, there are two main catalysts that will help the surge of the Tesla (TSLA) price this year. One is the expected Tesla Model 3 Highland launch in North America in Q4 and the start of Cybertruck deliveries. He posted the following analysis on his Twitter last week.

The Austin, TX-based automaker needs to fulfill a large number of pre-orders and ramp up Cybertruck production as fast as possible to make the vehicle a success story in the real world.
