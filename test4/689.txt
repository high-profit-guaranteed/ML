Tesla Inc TSLA, the electric vehicle giant led by Elon Musk, has seen its revenue surge to astronomical levels over the years, and its growth story is nothing short of remarkable. But a social media user seems to have stumbled upon a rather curious pattern.

What Happened: The conversation began with Jon Erlichman, a CTV National News anchor, sharing a fascinating perspective on Tesla’s revenue milestones.

He wrote, “Tesla’s revenue: 2023: $73,000 every 23 seconds, 2020: $73,000 every 1 minute, 34 seconds, 2015: $73,000 every 9 minutes, 2010: $73,000 every 5 hours, 2007: $73,000 for the year.”

Interestingly, $73,000 is currently the starting price of Tesla’s rival Rivian Automotive Inc‘s RIVN R1T pickup.

Why It Matters: Tesla’s revenue growth has been driven by a combination of factors, including its expanding lineup of electric vehicles, increasing demand for sustainable transportation options, and advancements in autonomous driving technology.

Erlichman himself pointed out a month ago that Tesla could reach the $100 billion annual revenue mark this year, faster than many large-cap companies.

The stock itself has a remarkable story since its initial public offering in June 2010, having skyrocketed a whopping 18,118% in 13 years.

As of the last close, Tesla shares were at $233.19, according to data from Benzinga Pro.
