The Electric Vehicle (EV) industry’s powerhouse, Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), recently held a first-delivery event to launch its Cybertruck. However, according to a survey conducted by the Canaccord Genuity team, 67% of respondents answered “no” as to whether they would buy the Cybertruck after the company revealed pricing and truck specifications.

On top of it, TSLA is facing a sales slowdown in its China-made EV sales. The China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) reported that the company’s sales of China-made EVs dropped 17.8% year-over-year to 82,432 cars in November. TSLA is also facing issues in Scandinavia regarding collective employee bargaining rights.

Given this backdrop, let’s look at the trends of TSLA’s key financial metrics to understand why it could be prudent to avoid the stock now.

Analyzing Tesla, Inc. Financial Figures: A Journey from December 2020 to September 2023

The provided data outlines the progression of TSLA’s trailing-12-month net income over the period from December 2020 to September 2023. A general summary and analysis of these figures are as follows:
• None As of December 31, 2020, TSLA reported a net income of $721 million.
• None We can see a consistent increasing trend in TSLA’s net income during this period. There has been significant growth in every quarter and substantial improvements yearly.
• None By March 31, 2021, the net income rose to $1.14 billion, followed by a more sizable increase to $2.18 billion on June 30, 2021.
• None The improvement continued substantially, with the net income hitting unprecedented heights going into 2022. By December 31, 2022, the net income was $12.56 billion.
• None However, in the first quarter of 2023, there was a slight decline to $11.75 billion, suggesting minor fluctuations despite the overall upward trajectory.
• None Despite this, the net income recuperated to $12.19 billion by June 30, 2023, but slipped again to $10.76 billion by the end of September of the same year.
• None Overall, TSLA demonstrated significant growth in its net income over the given period. The trend is generally ascending.
• None The growth from the starting value ($721 million in December 2020) to the final value ($10.76 billion in September 2023) indicates a stark contrast and suggests an impressive upward trajectory.
• None There were smaller fluctuations in the latter part of the series (2023), where the net income decreased, bucking the dominant upward trend, marking these periods as distinctive within the overall trend.

The data underlines the growth of TSLA’s profitability during this time, with a consistently rising trend seen in the net income, notwithstanding occasional downturns. It underscores TSLA’s remarkable financial progress over the period in view.

The trend and fluctuations in the gross margin of TSLA highlight a dynamic scenario over the observed interval, with an emphasis on recent data and concluding trends. In the following, we outline the significant markers and growth rate calculated from the first to the last value.
• None It commenced with a gross margin of 21.00% on December 31, 2020.
• None A gradual increase was visible in succeeding periods, reaching its peak at 27.10% on both March 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022.
• None Followed by a slight drop to 26.60% in September 2022 and a more significant fall to 25.60% on its last record in December 2022.
• None More recent data from 2023 shows a continued reduction in gross margin, down to 23.10% in March, 21.50% in June, and 19.80% in September.

Drawing attention to the growth rate from December 31, 2020, to September 30, 2023, there is an evident decrease in the gross margin from 21.00% to 19.80%.

Consequently, this marks a negative growth rate of 5.70%, signaling caution for investors and correlating to an increasingly cost-intensive operation for TSLA. Fluctuations in margins may reflect the company’s strategic decisions and economic conditions, which require further exploratory and contextual analysis.

The series of data you provided reflects TSLA’s Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) spanning from December 31, 2020, to September 30, 2023. Here’s an overview of the identified trends and fluctuations:
• None From December 2020 to December 2022, TSLA’s ROIC demonstrated an upward trend with some fluctuations. The ROIC grew from a meager 0.058 on December 31, 2020, to a robust 0.399 by December 31, 2022. This marks a noteworthy increase of over 587% across two years.

• None The highest ROIC value of 0.399 was observed at the close of 2022. Following this peak, there was a marked downturn in the first three quarters of 2023. By the end of September 2023, the ROIC settled at 0.247, marking a substantial reduction from its high point.

Overall, TSLA’s ROIC exhibited significant expansion followed by a downward correction in recent times. Further data is required to ascertain if this reduction trend will continue or bounce back.

The data represents the Return on Sales (ROS) of TSLA over a period from December 31, 2020, to September 30, 2023.
• None A clear upward trend in TSLA’s ROS is noticeable through the year 2022, followed by a declining trend in 2023.
• None On December 31, 2020, Tesla’s ROS was 5.6%. This figure progressively increased up to 17% on December 31, 2022, showing a significant growth rate.

• None In the final few quarters from March 2022 to September 2023, although mostly on a decline, ROS figures fluctuated slightly. For instance, the value reached a peak of 17% on December 31, 2022, before reducing to 15.1% on March 31, 2023, then marginally increasing to 16.8% on June 30, 2023, and eventually dropping to 12.4% by the end of September 2023.

Summarizing the growth rates, the price trend has been relatively volatile. There were periods of growth and decline, but no clear accelerating or decelerating trend occurred within this time period. The general trend suggests possible cyclical periods of growth and contraction.
