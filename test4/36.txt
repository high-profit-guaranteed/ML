Billionaire Elon Musk is working on launching an artificial intelligence start-up that will rival ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, the Financial Times reported on Friday citing people familiar with his plans. Twitter-owner Musk is assembling a team of AI researchers and engineers, according to the report, which added he is also in discussions with some investors in SpaceX and Tesla Inc TSLA.O about putting money into his new venture. Musk did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Musk has reportedly secured thousands of graphic processor units, systems that power high-powered computing required for tasks such as AI and high-end graphics, news site Business Insider reported earlier this week. Musk last month registered a firm named X.AI Corp, incorporated in Nevada, according to a state filing. The firm lists Musk as the sole director and Jared Birchall, the managing director of Musk's family office, as a secretary. It was not clear if the firm was related to Musk's reported AI start-up efforts. Musk did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. Musk is one of the co-founders of OpenAI, which was started as a non-profit in 2015. He stepped down from the company's board in 2018. Sign up for the Business & Innovation Newsletter >>
