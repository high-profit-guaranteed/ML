Investors also praised what looks like winning the charging wars – Volvo joins Ford and GM in accessing Tesla’s supercharger network.
• Tesla stock jumped 2.4% on Wednesday as buyers cheered another set of good news and some lofty expectations. First off, Tesla’s delivery numbers for the second quarter are just around the corner. Over the weekend, investors will be eyeballing 445,000 new cars shipped to happy owners, up from roughly 423,000 in the prior quarter.
• What’s more, Elon Musk’s EV maker struck another big partnership. Starting in 2025, Volvo drivers will get access to Tesla’s supercharger network spanning across the US. The Swedish carmaker, owned by Chinese group Geely, joins Ford and General Motors in using Tesla’s network of 12,000 superchargers.
• Tesla shares have been on a tear this year. The company has sparked a rally that has so far returned a roughly 140% increase since early January. In value terms, Tesla is sitting on an $800bn market cap but is still some $400bn away from its record-high market cap hit in November 2021.
