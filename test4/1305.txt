The Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) Cybertruck has finally arrived, at least for 10 customers at the company’s launch event Thursday.

CEO Elon Musk unveiled the long-awaited vehicle at the company's Austin Gigafactory with a series of testing videos, measuring the truck’s tow power, speed and even resistance to bullets.

The Cybertruck has 11,000 pounds of towing capacity and out-pulled a Ford F-350 diesel in a tow test. It also out-pulled an F-150 Lightning and Rivian R1T in the same test, which offers a sense of which vehicles Musk sees as competitors in the space.

Another flashy test saw the Cybertruck "Cyberbeast" edition beat a Porsche 911 in a race — while it towed another Porsche 911. Tesla’s truck reached 60 miles per hour in 2.6 seconds and traveled a quarter-mile in less than 11 seconds.

Then there were the guns. In another video, Musk and company fired a Tommy gun magazine at the body of a Cybertruck, and it held.

“If Al Capone showed up with a Tommy gun and emptied the entire magazine, you’d still be alive,” Musk told attendees.

In terms of price, the rear-wheel drive version will retail for $49,890, the all-wheel drive version for $68,890 and the Cyberbeast edition for $68,890, according to Tesla's website.
