Exactly three years ago tomorrow, Tesla Inc. finally started trading on the S&P 500 Index. Since then, the company’s stockholders have been on a wild ride that’s left them wondering if they should’ve just put their money in the broad equities benchmark.

Tesla shares closed around $232 on Dec. 18, 2020, the session before the company joined the S&P 500. Today they’re about $247, a 6.7% increase based on closing prices. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has climbed roughly 27%, led by mega-cap technology stocks such as Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. Tesla, which has the seventh-largest weighting in the index, is among the bottom half of S&P performers over that time.
