Shares of Tesla (TSLA) have fallen over 27% year to date, with fellow Magnificent Seven companies Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) also lagging behind the rest of the group. Are these companies doomed to fall from the pack or does the dip represent an opportunity to buy?

Canaccord Genuity LLC Managing Director George Gianarikas joins Yahoo Finance to highlight how Tesla could turn its lagging performance around and remain a worthwhile opportunity for investors.

Gianarikas notes that for Tesla's stock to experience a turnaround, several developments must emerge from the automaker's record research and development spending: "First, the next generation vehicle has to start to ramp, or people have to gain confidence that it's going to ramp and be successful. Second, their margins need to go up. The most likely lever for that happening is the increase of FSD, full self-driving penetration, which leverages the AI they built, in addition to volume starting to pick up. Third is continuation in growth. Really good growth in their energy storage business."

- Tesla is a Magnificent 7's biggest laggard year to date, but it's not the only one. Shares of Apple and Alphabet are also in the red since the start of the year. Now this week, we are focusing on these three laggards and what it's going to take for the companies to turn things around.

Today, the focus is Tesla, currently trading just around 179 bucks a share, a loss of nearly 30% this year alone. Our next guest, though, saying that now could be a good buying opportunity. For more on that and what the catalyst will be, we want to bring in George Gianarikas.

He's with Canaccord Genuity as a managing director there. George, it's great to see you. So talk to us about why you think Tesla is a buy at these levels?

GEORGE GIANARIKAS: Well, first, let's address the reason why it's lagged. I mean, it's pretty simple. The numbers have come down. I mean, if you look at the earnings revisions for the last 12 plus months, they've been terrible.

I mean, I think we started for 2023 somewhere early in that year on $6, and it came all the way down to $3. And I think we're at a period of time right now where the worries likely exceed the reality. And we had some numbers last week come out of China that weren't very good.

But people didn't take into account that the new year has been pushed into February. Also, some stuff that happened. In Germany, their plant came down for about a week because of arson, a week plus. And in the US, people are worried about the production of their new Model 3.

And we think that the best way to kind of gauge for the most part of what's happening with Tesla, particularly in the US, is to look at their prices. And they've been pretty stable in the US over the last couple few months. So there's a lot of wood to chop still in the quarter. But in the near term, we think that we may have overcorrected here to the downside.

- They talked on their most recent earnings call, George, about the spending and some of the record R&D that they had done during 2023, which now places a lot of emphasis on bringing that to fruition in 2024 and years following now. How much of that spending do you anticipate will lean further towards the side of this artificial intelligence narrative that has started to prevail with Tesla, even though we've seen some early slippage this year, at least, in the price action?

GEORGE GIANARIKAS: Look, we're in a little bit of a pause period right now for the stock. And the near term wiggles, we think we've overcorrected. But for the stock to really get its legs, we have to have three things happen. First, the next generation vehicle has to start to ramp, or people have to gain confidence that it's going to ramp and be successful.

Second, their margins need to go up. And the most likely lever for that happening is the increase of FSD, full self-driving penetration, which leverages the AI that they've built, in addition to volumes starting to pick back up. And third, it's continuation in growth, really good growth in their energy storage business.

So when you talk about leveraging this R&D that they've spent a lot on, it's two real products that come out of that, the big spending. It's number one, that next generation vehicle, which we think should start production in the second half of 2025 and continued FSD penetration.

Now we think that the FSD offering from the company at $12,000 currently is a little too rich, particularly relative to the cost of the vehicle. We think the company should cut the price of that FSD to really increase penetration and really have the margins start to turn in. If you think about it, that offering is about 100% gross margin very, very high gross margin because it's a software upgrade.

- George, we have seen, though, the price wars play out, obviously, Tesla far from the only automaker, one of many, I should say, that has been forced to lower the prices, obviously, putting pressure on margins, very similar to what you were just saying. How do you see that more broadly speaking beyond Tesla shaking out just a bit? And that pressure to the downside in terms of boosting demand, how much longer are they going to be forced to prices in order to drive the demand that we simply have not seen?

GEORGE GIANARIKAS: Well, look, there's been a pause, like I said, recently. Particularly, in the US, the price declines that we saw for the most part in 2023 is sort of ebbed right now, which for us, is indication that maybe things aren't that bad. And what the company did strategically by being that aggressive is, first of all, they got to sell more vehicles.

Right? Because interest rates went up, and most people finance the purchase of their vehicles. So that meant that the prices of vehicles went up artificially. But second, it put a lot of their competitors on their back legs.

I mean, margins got a lot worse for some of the pure play EV competitors. Sales got a lot worse for them. And even for the traditional OEMs that try to compete against Tesla, their margins got significantly worse because they couldn't compete with Tesla on price. So what we saw is-- longer term what Tesla did is put a lot of its competition on the back foot, particularly in the United States and Europe.

- And so, let's talk then about China because that's one of the larger kind of lingering risks right now for Tesla. Is sentiment shifting so much in the region that there would be a longer term implication for how Tesla is able to operate and sell into China, as well?

GEORGE GIANARIKAS: That's a great question. I mean, look, we see the real competition for Tesla long term, like, we really like Rivian in the United States, and in parts of Europe, and other parts of North America. But in China, specifically, there are some very, very good OEM competitors from pure play EV companies.

The company has one plant in China right now, able to produce about 950,000 vehicles. And they're running-- despite this monthly volatility, they're running full tilt there. And we'll continue-- we continue to believe they'll run full tilt in that country. So there's really good competition in China, but we think Tesla can operate that factory at relatively full capacity that leaves them in a good place in that country.

- So, George, as we wrap this up, we started this segment talking about the share price being under pressure. We're trading around 179 bucks a share today. What more specifically does that upside look like?

GEORGE GIANARIKAS: Look, our price target is in the 230s, and we base that on 26 times our 2026 estimates. And we think that's going to happen as volumes start to pick up next year and the year after that based on increased Cybertruck production and the next generation vehicle.

And importantly, we think that the margins will start to get better, particularly as we've seen an abatement and price reductions, at least, for now and costs continue to come down for the company. So, in the near term, we have these wiggles. And we think like we said, we've overcorrected to the downside in the near term.

But for real outperformance, we need to-- next generation vehicle or some visibility into that increased margins based on FSD mostly and continued growth in their energy storage business. Those three things will really get the stock to get its outperformance legs of old back.
