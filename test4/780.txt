The fact that multiple Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.

While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.

Tesla Insider Transactions Over The Last Year

The Technoking of Tesla, Elon Musk, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.9b worth of shares at a price of US$220 each. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$249, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 4.2% of Elon Musk's stake.

I will like Tesla better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.

The last three months saw some Tesla insider selling. CFO, Corporate Controller & Chief Accounting Officer Vaibhav Taneja only netted US$44k selling shares, in that period. It's not great to see insider selling, nor the lack of recent buyers. But the amount sold isn't enough for us to put any weight on it.

Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Tesla insiders own about US$114b worth of shares (which is 14% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.

So What Does This Data Suggest About Tesla Insiders?

While there has not been any insider buying in the last three months, there has been selling. But given the selling was modest, we're not worried. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Tesla, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.
