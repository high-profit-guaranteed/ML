Shares in Royal Mail’s parent company, International Distributions Services, have jumped 5%, as traders consider the savings it could make from fewer deliveries.

Regulator Ofcom has said cutting Royal Mail’s six-day a week letter deliveries to five days or three days could save between £100m and £650m.

“There was some cheer for bosses at Royal Mail owner International Distributions Services as regulators said it could possibly reduce its delivery days for the privatised UK postal service to three days a week,” Mould said.

“This would significantly reduce costs, although it would likely face opposition from unions and see the company come under significant political pressure if it were to take such drastic action,” he added.

The Royal Mail’s universal service obligation (USO) stipulates that it must deliver letters six days a week to all 32 million addresses in the UK for the price of a stamp, no matter where the letters are going.
