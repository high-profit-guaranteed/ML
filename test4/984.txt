Tesla Inc TSLA CEO Elon Musk on Sunday reacted to photographs of the Cybertruck beside Rivian Automotive Inc‘s RIVN R1T doing the rounds online.

What Happened: The picture was apparently taken at a Tesla supercharger in Kettleman City California. The pictures offer a side-by-side comparison of the two vehicles and serve for the fans of the two brands to battle each other on which one looks better.

“The Rivian looks like something from the 90s, next to the Cybertruck!,” one wrote.

“Wow! I like them both!” another wrote.

“When looks are compared side to side, I am in love with how the Rivian looks,” yet another chipped in.

Though the Cybertruck was expected to be much bigger, the prototype vehicle in the photograph looks roughly the same size as the R1T. Tesla is yet to release the specifications of the Cybertruck.

Musk Reacts: A Tesla shareholder reposted the pictures with the caption, “Cute couple. It’s very obvious which one is the man.”

Musk responded with a cryptic laughing emoji to the comment.

Why It Matters: At the company's annual shareholder meeting earlier this year in May, CEO Elon Musk confirmed that the Cybertruck delivery event would be held this year.

Though the company has not announced a date for the event to date, fans and enthusiasts have been awaiting the vehicle since its announcement in 2019 and more avidly since the last quarter.
