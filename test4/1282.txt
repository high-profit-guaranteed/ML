Tesla China’s insurance registrations for the week ending November 26, 2023, showed a slight improvement compared to the previous week. Over the week of November 20-26, Tesla China saw 16,700 insurance registrations across the country.

This represents a 2.45% increase from the 16,300 insurance registrations that were tracked from the third week of November. For context, Tesla China also saw 14,000 insurance registrations in November’s first week and 12,700 insurance registrations in the second week of the month.

Considering the insurance registrations that have been tracked for Tesla China so far, it would appear that the electric vehicle maker has seen about 56,000 vehicle insurance registrations from the domestic Chinese market from November 1 to November 26, as noted in a CNEV Post report. There are still a few days left in the month as well, so Tesla China seems like it has a very decent chance of ending November on a strong note.

Tesla China does not post its weekly sales numbers, though a general idea of the country’s overall automotive market could be inferred from the number of new vehicle registrations that are filed per week. Fortunately, industry insiders and companies such as Li Auto, which produces electric vehicles, have taken it upon themselves to aggregate and post China’s weekly insurance figures.

Since starting the domestic deliveries of the upgraded Model 3, better known in EV circles as the Model 3 Highland, Tesla China’s insurance registrations have seen a notable rise. As observed by Wall Street veteran and Tesla bull Gary Black, Tesla China’s 16,700 insurance registrations for the week ending November 26 is the highest this fourth quarter so far.

It should be noted that Tesla China also ended the third week of November with an impressive 16,300 insurance registrations. With this in mind, Tesla China’s fourth quarter insurance registrations are now just below the company’s record quarter, and there are still five weeks left in Q4 2023.
