Ark sold 149,780 shares of Coinbase through ARKK and ARKW, a platform that allows users to trade in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin BTC/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD. Coinbase shares closed 0.43% higher at $161.86.

This decision aligns with Wood’s recent strategy amidst the ongoing crypto market volatility, as Ark Invest looks to adjust its portfolio in response to the changing landscape, a scenario explored in a Benzinga report.

Additionally, Ark Invest offloaded 398,383 shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC from its ARKW fund. This move is indicative of Wood’s strategic shift in the face of potential regulatory changes affecting Bitcoin ETFs, potentially diminishing Grayscale’s competitive edge, as discussed in a recent analysis by Benzinga.

Ark Invest bought 16,271 shares of META Platforms Inc META worth $5.7 million, reinforcing its focus on major tech companies. The purchase was made through Ark Fintech Innovation ETF ARKF. Notably, Wood had loaded up on $12 million worth of Meta shares on Dec. 12. The earlier report noted that Meta stands to benefit from recovery in ad spending and its exposure to artificial intelligence.
• The firm also increased its holdings in Zoom Video Communications , purchasing 133,003 shares for ARKK and 24,899 for ARKW.
• Another notable buy was 158,334 shares of Block Inc , highlighting Ark’s interest in innovative fintech solutions.
