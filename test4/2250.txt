Good Morning Traders! In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.

Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.

We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis:

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust The SPY ETF (ARCA: SPY) is presently trading around the key level of 505.32. For those looking for upward movement, the initial target is 506.06. Should the market sustain above this level, the next goal for buyers is to reach 506.71, which is considered a support level. Holding above 506.71 could signal further upward momentum, aiming for 507.52. On the bullish side, if SPY manages to maintain its strength above 507.52 during the trading session, the ultimate objective for the day is to reach 508.34. This level represents the high target for bulls, indicating significant buying interest and positive market sentiment.

Conversely, if SPY fails to maintain support at 505.32, the market may see bearish activity. The initial downside target for bears is 503.95, where the market will test selling pressure. A breach below this level would lead to further tests at 502.85, indicating increased bearish momentum. Should selling intensify, the next critical support level to watch is 501.74. A breakdown below this point could lead to a significant bearish move, with the final bear target for the day set at 500.91. This level represents a key point where bears aim to push the market, highlighting potential downside risks.

Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 The QQQ ETF (NASDAQ: QQQ) is currently navigating around the pivotal level of 435.88. Bullish investors aim to push the price above 436.58, looking for it to act as a solid support level. If successful, the next target is 437.47, which bulls hope to establish as a new support base, potentially leading to further upward movement towards 438.89. If the market momentum remains positive, bulls will look to challenge the 440.00 level, with the ultimate bull target for the day being 440.78. Achieving this target would indicate strong buyer dominance and a favorable outlook for the QQQ ETF.

On the flip side, if QQQ struggles to stay above 435.88, bears might take the upper hand, driving the price down to 434.76. This would be the first test of bearish strength, with a further downside target at 433.64 if the selling pressure persists. A continued bearish trend could see QQQ dropping to 432.84, and if this support level fails, the final bear target for the day is set at 431.82. This level represents the lowest point bears aim to reach, signifying a significant downward movement if achieved.

Apple Inc. Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock is currently trading near the 182.27 level. Bulls are eyeing this level to hold as support, with an immediate target of 182.96. Sustaining above this could lead to further bullish momentum, pushing the price towards 183.38. If the bullish trend continues, the next objective for buyers is to surpass 184.09, marking the high bull target for the day. Achieving this would indicate strong buying interest and a positive sentiment towards Apple's stock.

However, if Apple fails to maintain support at 182.27, the market could see a downward trend, with the initial bear target set at 181.25. A break below this level would indicate bearish pressure, leading to a potential test of 180.60. With continued selling, the next level to watch is 180.10. If this support fails, the final bear target for the day is 179.36, suggesting a significant bearish outlook if reached.

Microsoft Corp. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is currently finding its footing around 406.01. Bulls are looking for the stock to hold above this level, aiming for an initial rally to 407.11. If this level acts as strong support, the next target for upward movement is 408.46. Continued buying could propel Microsoft's stock towards the high bull target of 409.69 for the day. Reaching this level would signify robust bullish momentum and positive market sentiment.

Conversely, if Microsoft cannot maintain support at 406.01, bears may aim to push the price down to 404.92. A break below this level would signal increased bearish activity, with a further downside target at 402.74. If the bearish trend persists, the next critical level is 401.39. Failing to hold this could lead to a move towards the day's low bear target of 400.30, marking a significant bearish stance if achieved.

NVIDIA Corporation NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) is currently oscillating around the crucial level of 775.50. Bulls are aiming for an upward push to 781.59, seeking to establish it as a firm support level. If successful, the next target is 785.35, with the potential to further rally to 787.68. If buying continues to dominate, NVIDIA could see its price reaching the high bull target of 791.44 for the day, indicating strong bullish momentum and a favorable market outlook.

On the contrary, if NVIDIA fails to hold the 775.50 level, bears might drive the price down to 771.72. A breakdown below this level could signal a bearish trend, with the next target at 768.67. Persistent selling could lead to a test of 765.63, and if this level doesn't hold, the final bear target for the day is 761.29. This level represents a significant bearish objective, highlighting potential downside risks.

Alphabet Inc Class A Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) stock is currently trading around 138.39. Bulls are looking to secure 139.46 as a support level, aiming for an upward move to 140.05. Sustaining bullish momentum could lead to reaching the high bull target of 140.57.

However, if Alphabet cannot maintain support at 138.39, bears may aim to lower the price to 137.79. A breach below this level would indicate a bearish trend, with a further downside target at 136.94. Continued bearish pressure could push Alphabet's stock down to 136.29, marking the low bear target for the day. Reaching this level would signify a significant bearish outlook for Alphabet.

Meta Platforms Inc Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is currently positioned around 483.11. Bulls are aiming to keep the price above 485.96, with a subsequent target of 488.81. A strong bullish trend could lead to a further rally to 492.33. If the buying interest persists, Meta could see its price reaching the high bull target of 495.54 for the day, indicating a strong bullish momentum and positive sentiment towards the stock.

Conversely, if Meta cannot hold the 483.11 level as support, bears might target a move down to 480.96. A continuation of the bearish trend could lead to a test of 479.47. With sustained selling, the next level to watch is 477.50, marking the low bear target for the day. This level represents a significant bearish stance if reached, highlighting potential downside risks for Meta.

Tesla Inc. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is currently navigating around the key level of 200.43. Bulls aim for an upward push to 201.85, with a potential rally towards 204.33. A bullish market trend today could lead to testing higher levels at 206.71. If there is significant buying interest, Tesla could reach the high bull target of 209.51 for the day, indicating a strong bullish momentum and positive market outlook.

However, if Tesla fails to maintain support at 200.43, bears might aim for a downward move to 197.50. Continued selling could bring the price down to 195.91. If bearish pressure continues, the next target is 193.81, marking the low bear target for the day. Achieving this level would highlight a significant bearish trend for Tesla, indicating potential downside risks.

Final Word: The market is bracing for volatility with the upcoming release of the second GDP reading for Q4 and the Core PCE Price Index in the premarket session. Additionally, speeches from Fed officials Bostic, Collins, and Williams are scheduled, which could impact market sentiment. Good luck and trade safely!
