On Tuesday, Tesla Inc TSLA CEO Elon Musk said that the EV giant will look into how its vehicles are being rented by car rental company Hertz Global Holdings Inc HTZ.

“We will look into this,” Musk said. The CEO was responding to a user who recounted his experience of renting two Model 3 vehicles at John Wayne Airport in California on X (formerly Twitter). Both the cars came without mobile charging cables, and the user had to order two EV chargers on Amazon and Tesla adapters. A Hertz employee allegedly told the individual that only one out of 10 Tesla vehicles comes with a charger cable because customers do not return them.

“Lots of people might rent a Tesla and it's their first experience with a Tesla. Including a mobile charging cable ensures people have the best possible experience with Tesla and Hertz,” the user wrote.

Why It Matters: During the company’s second-quarter earnings call last month, Hertz CEO Stephen Scherr said that EVs account for 11-12% of Hertz’s overall fleet and that it is the majority of Tesla EVs. On average, Hertz had a fleet of 560,000 vehicles in the quarter, he added.
