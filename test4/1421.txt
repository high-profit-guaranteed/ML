Tesla Inc. will receive 2.63 billion pesos ($153 million) in incentives from the Mexican state of Nuevo Leon to build its next major factory there, as state officials seek to assuage local concerns about delays to the electric-vehicle maker’s plant.

The incentives, approved by the state’s economic development council, include the creation of basic infrastructure such as roads and water treatment, as well as a reduction in payroll tax, the Nuevo Leon government said in a statement Thursday.
