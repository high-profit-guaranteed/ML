Tesla issued a recall for 2.2 million vehicles in the United States due to concerns regarding the font size of warning lights on the instrument panel.

This font size discrepancy is reported to be in violation of federal safety standards. The NHTSA announced the recall following a routine audit of Tesla vehicles.

Tesla stated no knowledge of any accidents or injuries resulting from this issue. The recall affects various models, including the Model S (2012-2023), Model X (2016-2024), Model 3 (2017-2023), Model Y (2019-2024) and 2024 Cybertruck vehicles. The company plans to address the problem through an over-the-air software update, eliminating the need for owners to visit a Tesla service center. Owner notification letters will be sent out starting Mar 30.

Specifically, 2,388 complaints have been identified regarding steering control loss in select 2023 Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles.
