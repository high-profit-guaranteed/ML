Polestar Automotive Holding UK Plc plans to use Tesla Inc.’s charging port in its future electric vehicles, making it the fifth automaker to embrace what could become the new standard in the US.

Embracing Tesla’s North American Charging Standard will get Polestar drivers access to Tesla’s Superchargers in the US and Canada under the deal announced Thursday. The carmaker founded by Volvo Car AB and its Chinese parent Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. will equip models sold in the region with the NACS port from 2025.
