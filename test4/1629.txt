Tesla (TSLA) has significantly dropped the vehicle wrap prices that the company launched last year. The automaker added a new wrap color to the Model 3/Y palette, Satin Abyss Blue.

Tesla originally introduced 7 colors for the Model 3 and Model Y wraps. With the addition of the new color, the count has risen to 8 (of course 7+1=8). The price range of these wraps varied between $7,500 and $8,000.

With the latest update, the prices of Tesla Model Y and Model 3 wraps cost between $5,700 and $6,000. Tesla has reduced its wrap prices by $1,800 – $2,000 (check the table below for the list of new prices).

Tesla is expanding its Model Y and Model 3 wrap service which the company started with only 2 Tesla Service Centers in California — West Covina and Carlsbad. You can check with your nearest Tesla store/service center to confirm if this service is available in your area.

However, the Model 3/Y vehicle wrap service can only be availed by going to the Tesla online store here. After scanning the QR code of the color using the Tesla mobile app for Android and iOS, you will be guided further.

Tesla is also gearing up to start the Cybertruck wrap service, we expect the service to start in the following weeks or months.

According to Tesla, its OEM wraps are superior to the aftermarket solutions and have the following features and benefits:
