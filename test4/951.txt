Long-time Tesla Inc TSLA bear and GLJ Research CEO Gordon Johnson allegedly interviewed three Tesla owners in the past week who won’t buy another Tesla.

What Happened: In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Johnson said that he spoke to a 2021 Model 3 owner and Uber driver on Tuesday.

When asked if he liked his car, the owner initially hesitated but eventually conceded, “Sure, it’s great.”

However, his reluctance to buy another Tesla became evident as he explained, “No… I will wait for the price to drop more, or other EV options to come out before buying another TSLA.”

He appreciated the car and its software but voiced concerns about pricing and depreciation. He also felt that the Full Self-Driving (FSD) package was “too much at $15K; I’m not rich.”

“I asked him if he had taken long trips, and he said his furthest was 3hrs, but there were issues charging (although, admittedly, he said that’s gotten better over the yrs – more superchargers),” Johnson said.

In a prior interview, Johnson discussed a doctor’s ownership experience with a 2022 Model Y. The doctor expressed dissatisfaction with the vehicle’s interiors and certain hardware components. Despite these complaints, the doctor lauded Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) capabilities and software. Notably, the doctor was waiting for other automakers like Mercedes and Ford to offer alternatives to Tesla.

Earlier this week, he also claimed to have spoken to a young girl driving a 2023 Model Y. She reportedly raised issues with the car’s suspension and automatic braking systems. Her trust in the car’s autonomous capabilities was lacking, and her family was actively exploring non-Tesla options.

Fans Backlash: Despite the detailed anecdotes, several X users have flagged how Johnson only seemed to have interviewed Tesla owners who meet his narrative.

“Of course, he doesn't report on the 10x of people who love their Tesla vehicles. But hey, everyone has to be known for something and Gordon's found his niche in life,” a user, also a self-confessed EV enthusiast, wrote.

Some have also accused the analyst of fabricating these interviews.

“And again, on today's episode of ‘Things that never happened’… Gordon, a man with a stellar track record, has an imaginary conversation with himself and tries to pass it off as real,” another wrote.

Johnson’s comments have largely been ignored by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, but last month the billionaire entrepreneur mocked the analyst’s track record, highlighting his consistent inaccuracy in making predictions.
