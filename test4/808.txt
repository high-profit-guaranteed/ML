On Wednesday, Tesla Inc TSLA CEO Elon Musk said that the EV giant might offer a solution to protect its upcoming cybertrucks from getting keyed.

What Happened: Musk said that Tesla might be able to offer an optional tungsten carbide coating on its Cybertrucks to reduce the risk of being keyed. Tungsten carbide, the CEO said, is scratch-proof to everything below diamond hardness.

The CEO responded to an X user who wrote, “People who try to key a cybertruck will be ruining their keys.” The user was seemingly hinting at the stainless steel exoskeleton of the cybertruck touted to be ‘nearly impenetrable’ by Tesla themselves.

Why It Matters: The practice of individuals damaging vehicle exteriors or paint jobs using keys or similar objects is something that poses trouble to vehicle owners across brands and countries.

Tesla offers the sentry mode on its models S, 3, X, and Y to guard against potential threats, including keying. If the sentry mode is activated, the cameras on the vehicle remain powered on to record any suspicious activity around the vehicle. On a threat being detected, the driver will receive an alert on their mobile app, and footage recorded by the cameras will be saved to a USB drive.
