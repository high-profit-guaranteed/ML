Good Morning Traders! In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, TSLA, META, and GOOGL.

Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members during our daily Morning Call, prior to the opening of the market.

We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis:

The SPY SPY has witnessed a tumultuous overnight session. It is currently trading around our 430.05 benchmark. Bulls are eyeing an initial push to 430.62. With sustained buying, 431.04 becomes the next target. If buying pressure persists above 431.04, we anticipate a surge towards our support at 431.78. The ultimate bullish objective for today is 432.28.

If support at 430.05 is breached, bears will likely test 429.61. Should selling pressure intensify, the next level in focus is 429.28. A considerable downward move could touch our robust support at 428.62. For a notably bearish day, the ultimate target is 427.71.

The Q's QQQ have exhibited an upward gap overnight and are presently trading around our pivotal 357.94 point. Bulls hope to establish ground above 357.94. If this level remains unbreached, 358.60 becomes the focal point. Persistent buying might usher in the 359.39 mark. With pronounced buying activity, 360.08 emerges as the next target. The ultimate bullish goal for today is 360.79.

Should the price falter at 357.94, we anticipate bears taking charge, driving the price towards 356.83. If this level succumbs, 355.93 becomes the next target, and an intensified selloff might challenge 355.32. The ultimate bearish goal for the day is 354.24.

Apple AAPL is currently trading around our 174.05 benchmark. Bullish traders aim for an initial surge to 175.09. If buying momentum endures, 175.81 emerges as the next objective. Strong bullish trends might touch 176.29, and if bulls assert dominance today, 176.84 becomes the target. The peak bullish aim for today is 177.31.

If the rally falters before reaching 175.09, a dip to 174.05 is likely. Continued selling pressure could push the price to 173.24. If this level is breached, the next bearish goal is 172.35.

Microsoft MSFT currently trades slightly beneath our 318.48 support. Bulls hope to reclaim and maintain 318.48. A sustained upward trend could reach 320.05. Vigorous buying might target 321.51, and with continued momentum, 323.17 is in sight. Today's peak bullish target for Microsoft is 324.81.

If 318.48 does not hold, we anticipate bears driving the price to 316.04. Intensified selling might target 313.61. In a notably bearish scenario, the price might plunge to 311.91.

Tesla TSLA currently trades around our pivotal 242.47 point. Bulls aim for a surge to 243.98. A sustained uptrend would target 246.16, and with pronounced buying, the top goal becomes 248.37.

If 242.47 is breached, a dip to 239.92 becomes likely. Intensified selling could challenge 238.50, and in a pronounced bearish scenario, the target is 235.74.

Meta META trades around our 297.33 benchmark. Bulls hope to consolidate at and then surpass this level, setting their sights on 300.23. Strong buying could push the price to 301.71, and with continued momentum, 304.77 emerges as the top target.

Should 297.33 fail to hold, bears might target 295.97. If this level is breached, intensified selling might challenge 293.91.

Alphabet GOOGL currently trades around our 129.52 benchmark. Bulls are eyeing 130.41 as the next target. Persistent buying might aim for 131.28 and subsequently 131.76. The ultimate bullish objective for today is 132.22.

If support at 129.52 is compromised, bears might target 128.91. Intensified selling could challenge 128.34, and in a notably bearish scenario, the aim becomes 127.71.

Final Word: As we navigate the concluding week of September and Q3, anticipate major players adjusting their portfolios for the quarterly rebalance come Friday. Keep a close watch on the options chain for insights and remain vigilant. Approach today's trading session with patience and discipline. Good luck, and trade safely!
