Tesla Inc. is scheduled to report earnings after Wednesday’s close. The stock hit a record high of $414.50/share in 2021 and is currently trading near $211/share. The stock is prone to big moves after reporting earnings and can easily gap up if the numbers are strong. Conversely, if the numbers disappoint, the stock can easily gap down. To help you prepare, here is what the Street is expecting:

The company is expected to report a gain of $0.74/share on $23.17 billion in revenue. Meanwhile, the so-called Whisper number is a gain of $0.77/share. The Whisper number is the Street's unofficial view on earnings.

A Closer Look At The Fundamentals

The company’s earnings have been bumpy over the past few years. The company earned $0.75 in 2020, $2.26 in 2021, $4.07 in 2022, then analysts expect the company earned $3.05 in 2023 and will earn $3.65 in 2024. Growth investors want to see the company grow both its top and bottom line again as it moves forward. Meanwhile, value investors want to see the valuation drop a little as the P/E ratio is currently 58, which is higher than the S&P 500. This earnings report will be important because demand has waned recently for electric vehicles and investors want to see a bullish catalyst.

A Closer Look At The Technicals

Technically, the stock enjoyed a massive run in 2023 after falling sharply at the end of 2022. Over the last several months, the stock has moved sideways as it paused to consolidate the big run it had since January 2023. Big sideways consolidations (a.k.a. bases) are normal and healthy. There’s an old adage on Wall Street that says, the longer the base, the higher in space. Meaning, when a stock breaks out from a long base, odds favor it has more room to run. Technically, the bulls want to see the stock gap up after reporting earnings and the bears want to see it gap down.

Pay Attention To How The Stock Reacts To The News

From where I sit, the most important trait I look for during earnings season is how the market and a specific company reacts to the news. Remember, always keep your losses small and never argue with the tape.
