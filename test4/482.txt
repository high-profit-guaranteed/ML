Shares of the EV maker have soared this year, adding more than 160% to Tesla’s valuation.
• The first unit of Tesla’s new electric pickup truck rolled off the assembly line this weekend. The highly anticipated Cybertruck was first introduced in 2019, and here we are – four years later you can get one starting from $39,900. A high-end make will set you back roughly $70,000.
• Boasting a futuristic look, or an odd shape if you’re in the critics camp, the Cybertruck is expected to usher in a new era of growth in the EV market. Wall Street analysts target roughly 10,000 units to be delivered in 2023, and ten times that amount in 2024. Cybertruck joins Tesla’s existing models S, 3, X, Y.
• Tesla stock gained 3.2% on Monday. Shares of the EV heavyweight, led by billionaire Elon Musk, closed above $290 a share, lifting the company’s market value above the $900bn mark for the first time since September. Tesla stock is riding on more than 160% in year-to-date gains.
