Tesla Inc.’s CEO Elon Musk is unsure about his Chinese lookalike being “real” after the latter’s shirtless boxing video surfaced on social media.

What Happened: Musk’s intrigue surrounding his uncanny Chinese doppelgänger, Yilong Ma, has been reignited by a recent video that emerged on the tech billionaire-owned Twitter, now rebranded as “X.”

In the video, Ma playfully engages in a mock boxing match with an opponent donning a box featuring a printout of Meta Platforms Inc.’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s face.

Musk responded to the video by saying, “Still don’t know if real or AI-generated,” along with a Face with Tears of Joy emoji.

Ma, whose resemblance to Musk is striking, initially gained viral attention on China’s Douyin platform in November 2020. Despite his popularity, his Douyin account was suspended in May 2022 without a clear explanation, according to Business Insider.

Why It’s Important: This isn’t the first time Musk has expressed uncertainty about his lookalike.

Previously, the tech billionaire had humorously speculated about his own potential Chinese heritage when a photo of Ma surfaced on Twitter.

In May 2022, Musk also voiced his willingness to meet Ma, but with a cautious acknowledgment of the prevalent use of deepfake technology.

Meanwhile, the highly-anticipated “cage match” between Musk and Zuckerberg took an exciting turn as the iconic tech duo started bantering about which platform to stream the fight on.

Zuckerberg also expressed his readiness to face Musk and proposed Aug. 26 as the potential date, but the tech billionaire might have to undergo surgery before the fight — so the timeline isn’t certain yet.
