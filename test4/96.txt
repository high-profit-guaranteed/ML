For those who believe in Tesla’s long-term potential, now could be a good time to buy Tesla stock as it is currently trading nearly 62% removed from its all-time high, which could represent a good opportunity to buy the stock at a discounted price.

In addition to trading far below its peak value, there are several other factors that could positively impact the price of TSLA over time, primarily the growing number of electric vehicles sold.

In this article, we are going to examine whether Tesla is a good stock to buy right now and consult our algorithmic Tesla stock forecasts.

Tesla's stock price experienced significant volatility in the past three years.

Tesla is a good stock to buy if you believe that Tesla will continue to dominate the electric vehicle market – and there are solid arguments to support that outlook.

In the past two years, Tesla’s market share of sold battery-electric vehicles in the US remained above 60%, despite its competitors' growing efforts to cut into the company’s dominant market presence.

According to data from Cox Automotive, the number of EVs sold in the past couple of years has increased considerably – from 98,862 units in Q1 2021 to 258,885 in Q1 2023, more than a 160% increase in just two years.

As of April 2023, Tesla has produced over 1 million units since it first started manufacturing its first Roadster sports car model in 2008. Interestingly, the company has sold nearly two times as many units, meaning that there is a significant backlog of orders the EV manufacturer must fulfill.

In the past couple of quarters, Tesla considerably ramped up its vehicle manufacturing – according to the Q1 2023 earnings report, Tesla produced 422,000 and delivered 440,000 vehicles in the first quarter of this year.

The increase in deliveries resulted in a +24.4% year-over-year (YoY) increase in revenue, which reached $23.3 billion in Q1. Despite the strong business results, both the stock price and net income dropped by roughly -23% in the same period. The drop saw Tesla CEO Elon Musk momentarily lose his spot as the world’s richest man.

There is significant room for growth for electric vehicles in the long term. If we assume that the number of electric vehicles in comparison to vehicles with internal combustion engines will continue to increase, Tesla could be in a prime position to take advantage of this trend.

Last year, the number of electric vehicles sold (807,956 units) accounted for less than 6% of all light vehicles sold in the US (13,754,300 units). By 2030, US legislators aim to increase the share of new EVs sold to 60 percent and to 67 percent by 2032.

Let’s say that electric vehicles will account for 50% of all light vehicles sold in the US by 2030 (with the number of vehicles the same as last year) and that Tesla will manage to maintain 30% of the total EV market share (down over double from 62% last quarter). Under that set of assumptions, Tesla would sell a whopping 2.4 million units in 2030, three times as many as in 2022.

According to our Tesla (TSLA) price prediction, the price of TSLA is predicted to increase by +35% in the next month, which could be a good opportunity to buy Tesla stock. Following the spike in May, our stock price forecast algorithm predicts a significant move to the bottom, with the share price eventually settling in the $130 range in the first part of 2024.

Our Tesla stock forecast algorithm is projecting a bearish start to 2024.

In the longer term, our algorithm forecasts a $2,200 price target for TSLA in 2030, which would mean that the stock would trade 1,331% above its current price.

At the time of writing, Tesla is the 11th largest company in the world, commanding a market cap of over $488 billion, and one of the biggest components of the S&P 500 Index (with 1.27%). If its stock would indeed gain 1,331%, then the market cap would increase past $6 trillion, over double that of Apple, which is currently the largest public company in terms of market valuation in the world. Whether the increase in vehicle sales will be enough to facilitate such a drastic increase in stock price remains to be seen.

In fact, it could be argued that Tesla is already overvalued, as the company commands a bigger market cap than the next four largest automobile companies combined, including Toyota, BYD Auto, Mercedez-Benz, and Volkswagen.

The bottom line: Now it could be a good time to invest in Tesla stock

Despite a large number of vehicle sales and deliveries, 2022 was a tough year for Tesla. Not only did its stock price take a big hit, the workforce was cut by 10,000 as well, as a wave of layoffs hit the tech sector.

Despite the company-specific set of challenges and the broader bearish market environment, it could be argued that now is a good time to buy Tesla stock due to its relatively low price, as long as you believe that the company is in a good position to continue to dominate the EV market.
