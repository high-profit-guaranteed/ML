Last week, Tesla Inc TSLA finally delivered the highly anticipated Cybertruck four years after unveiling its prototype. But Tesla only delivered a handful of units as it is still working on streamlining the production of its futuristic electric pickup. If this year showed us anything, it is how complex it is to electrify this particular vehicle. Even Ford Motor F didn’t have it easy bringing the electric-version of its bestselling pickup to life. But, automakers and automotive parts creators are not giving up. Today, Worksport WKSPWKSPW announced it expanded its factory production with an additional assembly line, meaning this innovative company is another step closer to bringing its solar-powered tonneau cover and portable battery system to life.

Worksport Revealed It Is Another Closer To Bringing Its Innovative Automotive Solutions To The Market

With now two assembly lines for its innovative hard-folding tonneau covers, Worksport claims it has made a significant progress on its mission of bringing innovative and sustainable automotive solutions to the world. Worksport recently announced it iniated the testing phase for its COR portable energy storage system with updates on the Alpha release due to be out soon. With the solar-powered tonneau cover SOLIS, this power duo provide solar power to pickups as well as everyone else wanting freedom from the grid as the COR battery system can be used independently to provide power on the go.

Worksport set the stage for this achievement in August this year when it began production at its U.S. facility located in West Seneca, New York. The second assembly line empowers Worksport to fulfill the substantial $16 million annual sales agreement it made earlier this year. In its third quarter, Worksport posted an impressive 2,399% YoY revenue growth due to gaining a new US after-market customer.

Thanks To Its Electric Pickup, The Lightning, Ford Set A New EV Sales Record

Last Friday, Ford CEO Jim Farley revealed that F-150 Lightning sales achieved a record in November as they more than doubled. Moreover, Ford sold 4,393 units of the Lightning, therefore selling more models during November than during the entire third quarter. It even edged out Rivian Automotive RIVN and its R1T. Rivian was to first to bring the electric pickup to the road, but in November, Ford became the best-selling EV brand behind the EV king itself, Tesla, in the U.S. Thanks to the Lightning, as well as Mustang Mach E whose sales also rose 21.3%, Ford sold 8,958 EVs in November, which is its new EV sales record. After deciding to scale back its EV investment, it is good to see Ford post some good EV news.

The tech-savvy Cybertruck threatens to dim the Lightening’s and R1T's glory as the upcoming Chevy Silverado RST electric pickup. The 2024 Tesla Cybertruck claims to have a range of 470 miles, leaving behind the Rivian R1T at 410 miles and the Ford F-150 Lightning with 320-miles. Their prices vary as well. The Cybertruck’s starting price is just over $81,000 while Rivian placed the starting price of $74,800 for its R1T. The most affordable one is offered by Ford, with the starting price of the Lightning at $52,090. But considering that all of the three have a history of fluctuating prices, these figures could change. There's also the fact that Tesla CEO openly admitted that there will be challenges on the way of ramping up the production of the Cybertruck, while Ford and Rivian are accelerating their production capacities.
