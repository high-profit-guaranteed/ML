The Tesla Chart: Tesla’s possible bear flag pattern was formed between Dec. 28 and Wednesday, with the downward sloping pole formed between Dec. 28 and Monday and the flag forming since. The measured move, if the pattern is confirmed with a sharp drop on higher-than-average volume, is about 21%, which suggests the stock could fall toward $171.
• Tesla is trading in a confirmed downtrend, making a series of lower highs and lower lows. The most recent lower high was formed on Monday at $217.80 and the most recent lower low was printed at the $206.27 mark on that same day.
• On Jan. 11, Tesla dropped under the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), which threw the stock into a bear cycle. If Tesla continues to trade under that area, the 50-day SMA will eventually cross below the 200-day, which will cause a death cross to form on the stock’s chart.
• Bullish traders want to see Tesla receive a positive reaction to its earnings print and for the stock to surge up and regain support at the 200-day SMA. Bearish traders want to see Tesla drop under Monday’s low on high volume, which could thrust Tesla under the $200 psychological support level and accelerate downside pressure.
• Tesla has resistance above at $213.13 and at $225.03 and support below at $200.51 and at $190.41.
