Tesla Inc TSLA has shown interest in acquiring Wiferion, a German company known for its specialized wireless charging systems for industrial EVs.

This news surfaces only a few months after Tesla hinted at a wireless home charging system for their EVs with an image during a corporate presentation, as shared by DriveTeslaCanada.

According to ntv, a German news outlet, Tesla has been cited in an industry portal called “Gründerszene.” The platform indicates that Wiferion has plans to sell to Tesla, with the commercial register listing Tesla International BV, a subsidiary of Tesla registered in the Netherlands, as the prospective buyer. The register states, “The shareholders intend to sell their shares in the company to Tesla International BV by means of a purchase agreement.”

Wiferion, a pioneer in wireless charging solutions for industrial applications, provides systems for mobile robots, automated guided vehicles (AGVs), and other battery-operated devices. This technology could potentially be adapted for use with consumer EVs. However, neither Tesla nor Wiferion have released any comments regarding the potential deal.

Earlier this year, during an Investor Day presentation, Tesla subtly featured a wireless induction charger being used to power a Model S in a residential garage. The charger, resembling a massive Wall Connector, was connected to a charging mat placed beneath the rear of the Model S.
