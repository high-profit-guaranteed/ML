Tesla Inc. ’s sprawling manufacturing hub in Austin, Texas, more than tripled its employee ranks last year, the company told county officials.

By the end of 2022 the carmaker had invested $5.81 billion in the 2,500 acre site, which it calls Gigafactory Texas, according to a 114-page annual compliance report Tesla filed with Travis County’s Economic Development Program. Just over half of its workers resided in the county and the average full-time employee there was paid at least $47,147 last year.
