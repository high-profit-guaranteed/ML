EV giant Tesla Inc TSLA is seemingly getting more confident in its full self-driving capabilities.

“Your car will be able to drive itself almost anywhere with minimal driver intervention and will continuously improve,” Tesla’s website now shows for customers looking to purchase its full self-driving capability.

The EV maker now also lists autosteer on city streets as one of the features of FSD. Autosteer was listed as a ‘coming soon’ feature for over 4 years until recently.

“This might seem like a small change, but it’s a big one. This indicates that Tesla is getting very confident in FSD’s capabilities,” a Tesla investor wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

CEO Elon Musk himself agreed to the takeaway and said, “Yup.”

Why It Matters: In July, Musk said at the 2023 World Artificial Intelligence Conference that Tesla is "very close" to achieving full self-driving capability.

“I have been wrong about this prediction in the past, but I feel we are closer to it than we ever have been,” Musk then said.

Last week, Tesla also cut the price of FSD capability by 20% from its previous tag of $15,000, making it significantly more affordable to customers. The feature is now priced at $12,000.
