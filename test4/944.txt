Why It’s Important: The Cybertruck has been the widely awaited EV of the year, and the company is scheduled to release the electric pickup truck in late 2023. CEO Elon Musk first made an announcement concerning the Cybertruck in November 2019, and the truck’s launch has seen an inordinate delay since then.

With the launch finally approaching, the excitement has been building, and Tesla fans have reported Cybertruck sightings on social media channels.

Future Fund’s Gary Black is among the analysts who are optimistic about the Cybertuck, expecting it to produce a halo effect and stimulating sales of other Tesla EVs once the truck launches. He expects Tesla to launch three variants of the Cybertruck, with the base and top trims priced at $49,900 and $79,900, respectively. The company has yet to confirm the details.

The Cybertruck at the auction fetched over eight times Black’s estimated price of the base trim.

Tesla closed Friday’s session up 0.18% at $260.53, according to Benzinga Pro data.
