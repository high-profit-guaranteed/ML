Will the company be able to maintain its winning streak this time around as well?

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share has remained unchanged in the past seven days. The estimate for the bottom line implies a year-over-year rise of 9.21%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues suggests year-over-year growth of 46.95%.

The company delivered 466,140 cars worldwide in the second quarter, up 83% from the year-ago quarter and 10% from the prior quarter. Total deliveries also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 444,569 units amid multiple price changes. Our estimate for the same was 434,736 units.



Tesla delivered 446,915 Model 3/Y units in the to-be-reported quarter, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 419,987 units. Our estimate for the same was 420,156 units. Stronger-than-expected deliveries for Model 3/Y are expected to play in favor of Tesla’s upcoming results.



Starting this year, Tesla offered steep discounts on its models in the United States, China and elsewhere to spur demand, which is also likely to have elevated automotive revenues to some extent. The automaker is riding on the robust demand for Models 3 and Y, which form a major chunk of its total deliveries.



The Zacks Consensus Estimate and our forecast for Tesla’s Energy Generation and Storage revenues are pegged at $1,690.90 million and $1573.70 million, respectively, suggesting a rise from $866 million recorded in the same quarter of 2022.



The Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate for revenues for Tesla’s Services and Other segment are pegged at $1,742 million and $1,954.30 million, respectively, implying growth from $1,466 million recorded in the same quarter of 2022.
