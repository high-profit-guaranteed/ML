On Tuesday, Elon Musk responded to a post on X, formerly Twitter, highlighting a significant number of Tesla Inc. TSLA Cybertrucks at Gigafactory, Texas, indicating that production of the electric pickup is accelerating.

What Happened: Tesla investor Sawyer Merritt posted a video by Brad Sloan which showed around 370 Cybertrucks parked in the Texas Gigafactory premises.

Why It Matters: The Cybertruck has become a symbol of status and fashion, with celebrities like Steve Aoki, Pharrell Williams, and Big Sean among the latest to own the electric vehicle. This surge in popularity follows the start of deliveries in November 2023, after the truck was first unveiled in 2019. The vehicle had over one million reservations, indicating its high anticipation.

Despite its popularity, regulatory bodies such as the National Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety (IIHS) have not scheduled crash tests for the Cybertruck. The lack of testing is attributed to its unique stainless steel body and lower production volumes. However, this could change with increased production and consumer interest.

Additionally, Musk has recently addressed quality concerns regarding the Cybertruck, particularly regarding door panel gaps. After a critical review by YouTuber Marques Brownlee, Musk clarified that the issue could be resolved quickly and had been corrected in the production process.
