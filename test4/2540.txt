Electric vehicle and clean energy company Tesla is currently the 15th most valuable company on the planet, commanding a market capitalization of approximately $559 billion.

Of course, many investors are wondering how Tesla will perform over the long term. After all, the electric vehicle market still has substantial room for growth, and Tesla seems to be positioned very well to take advantage of this.

In this article, we will be taking a look at some long-term scenarios for the price of Tesla stock, including a Tesla stock price prediction for 2040 and 2050.

Here’s an overview of Tesla stock’s price predictions under various relevant growth scenarios.

*The values in the table were calculated using TSLA’s price of $175.66 (as of March 21, 2024).

 **The S&P 500 has averaged 11.13% CAGR over the past 50 years, and NASDAQ's tech-focused QTEC index has averaged 15.2% since 2006.

Tesla stock’s average annual return for the past ten years has been around 40%. If this average annual return were to continue until 2040, Tesla stock would reach a price of $101,597. Needless to say, this figure seems impossible to achieve, so we need to use a more conservative benchmark to make a Tesla stock prediction for 2040.

The S&P 500 index had an average annual return of 11.13% between 1973 and 2023. If Tesla stock were to grow at this average rate until 2040, TSLA stock would be worth $1,056 in 2040. This would be about 2.5x the stock’s current all-time high price of $407.

Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index has displayed an average annual return of 15.2% between its inception in 2006 and 2024. If TSLA were to grow by 15.2% per year on average, Tesla stock would be worth $1,947. This would be about 11x the current Tesla stock price.

When it comes to the Tesla stock price forecast for 2050, Tesla stock would be trading at $3,035 in 2050 if it were to grow at the same 11.1% average rate as the S&P 500.

If TSLA were to grow at the same rate as the Nasdaq 100’s 15.2% average annual return, it would be worth $8,015 by 2050.

When it comes to more short-term predictions, the algorithmic Tesla price prediction from CoinCodex is currently forecasting TSLA to reach a peak of $275 in Q 2025. This would represent a 56% increase from the current price.

If we take a look at forecasts made by Wall Street analysts, the 1-year forecast for TSLA is mostly neural at the time of writing. Out of a sample of 34 analysts, the average target for TSLA stock is $207, which would represent a +18% increase from the current price.

Meanwhile, among the sample of analysts tracked by TipRanks, 18 analysts recommended investors hold TSLA stock. 10 analysts are recommending that investors should buy the stock, while 6 have given it a sell rating.

In January 2023, Tesla announced price cuts to its vehicles in the United States and Europe. The company’s high-profit margins give it significant room to maneuver and potentially pressure its competitors by cutting prices further. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Tesla saw $9,000 in net profit per vehicle sold, which was more than seven times higher than the comparable figure for Toyota Motor Corp.

In the face of a potential recession, the company said in an earnings release that it was working towards “accelerating our cost reduction roadmap and driving towards higher production rates.” Tesla outperformed its competitors in 2023 mainly through cost control and cost innovation.

By the end of 2023, Tesla initially aimed to produce 2.2 million vehicles. According to the company's own report, it fell short of that target, managing to produce "only" 1.81 million vehicles. Still, that was an impressive 35% year-over-year increase compared to 2022.

Of course, Tesla has also faced challenges in the recent past. The company’s shares declined substantially in the last quarter of 2022, and the stock’s 1-year performance is uninspiring -11.2% at the time of writing. In 2022, Elon Musk announced that the company would reduce its salaried headcount by 10%, which translated to about 10,000 employees at the time. There have also been reports of another wave of layoffs at Tesla in 2023.

Some of the factors that have contributed to the drop in Tesla’s valuation are increasing competition in the electric vehicle market, the uncertain macroeconomic outlook, and Elon Musk’s controversial acquisition of social media platform Twitter. Elon Musk’s $44 billion Twitter acquisition introduced concerns about whether Musk would be able to dedicate the same amount of focus to Tesla as he did before and also harmed Tesla’s brand image among some consumers.

Still, some of the concerns that led to the Tesla stock crash in 2022 appear to have been overblown. The stock has mounted an impressive recovery in 2023, as TSLA more than doubled in value. Whether that momentum can be extended into 2024 hinges on Tesla's ability to retain its dominating market share in the EV space, which is getting increasingly more difficult due to Western car manufacturers like Ford and Volkswagen and Chinese companies like BYD and Nio.

The bottom line: Tesla’s long-term prospects appear to be solid

With the increasing adoption of electric vehicles, Tesla is positioned well to continue growing in the future. While Tesla could certainly be negatively impacted if there is a recession in 2024, the company is likely to continue its success over the long term, and many investors believe Tesla will continue to dominate the EV market and find the TSLA stock a good buy at current prices.
