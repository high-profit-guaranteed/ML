One of the most anticipated product launches coming from Tesla Inc TSLA in the future is the humanoid robot known as Optimus, which was unveiled by the company in 2021.

Even though no date is set for the launch of the robot and the finalized version may still be years away, a prototype Tesla Bot is set to be displayed in Tesla stores to help boost traffic and potentially generate more buzz.

What Happened: Tesla CEO Elon Musk has highlighted the potential of the Optimus humanoid robot to help with labor shortages.

“It (Telsa Bot) has the potential to be a generalized substitute for human labor over time. The foundation of the economy is labor,” Musk previously said.

Tesla conducted trials in China, introducing display units of the Optimus humanoid robot into their stores. According to Electrek, these displays have drawn considerable attention, significantly increasing the number of visitors to Tesla's outlets.

The report from Electrek highlighted how Tesla’s retail stores in China are often the gold standard for the company. Tom Zhu, who previously led the company’s China business, was named Tesla’s Global Head Of Automotive Business earlier this year. Reports say Zhu has put pressure on the North American retail business of Tesla to perform like the Chinese retail business.

The Tesla Bot is now reported to be in Tesla retail locations in New York City, a move that could bring increased foot traffic and attention to the high-profile stores.

Why It’s Important: Retail sector companies have previously employed similar strategies, utilizing unique in-store displays or high-profile items exclusive to physical stores as a means to attract more visitors. Once the customers are in the store, the company's core products are then marketed and sold to them.

While Tesla's vehicles are a common sight on the roads and many people are familiar with them, the introduction of the Tesla Bot in stores may entice a new demographic of visitors. These individuals, initially attracted by the humanoid robot, might end up spending more time exploring and learning about Tesla's lineup of electric vehicles.

Tesla highlighted the Tesla Bot during its AI Day in September 2022.

Reports suggest that Tesla plans to initially deploy the Optimus Bot in its manufacturing operations before offering it to the public for commercial use. Among the interested parties in having a Tesla Bot at home is this NBA Hall of Famer.
