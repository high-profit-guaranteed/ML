The U.S. Justice Department is investigating personal benefits that may have been given to Elon Musk from Tesla (TSLA), according to a report from The Wall Street Journal. The investigation is reportedly part of an ongoing criminal probe that is also looking into other misuse of company funds, including the building of a glass house for Musk.

BRAD SMITH: We're also watching the largest EV automaker in the US today, as federal prosecutors are scrutinizing the benefits the company may have provided CEO Elon Musk since 2017. This according to a report by the Wall Street Journal. You take a look at shares here this morning. They're still higher by about 4/10 of a percent. So perhaps, investors shrugging this one off just a little bit here.

But no doubt, Elon Musk's compensation has been at the core of focus at different points over the past, we'll say, five years here. You think back to 2018, the infamous going private funding secured tweet. That restructured his entire compensation package. That took it out to tranches for him to get rewarded based on some of the stock performance as well. And so, all of that considered, I think the Department of Justice is going to have a lot, at these different phases, to look through, as to what he was awarded as a result of the different restructuring packages within his own compensation plan that were executed.

SEANA SMITH: Yeah, of course, that. And then, there's also Project 42, which was a secret project inside Tesla. And there's lots of questions just about the funding there, where exactly that came from. How, or whether or not, some of those funds were misused or misappropriated. So that's something that, reportedly from the Journal, that regulators are looking into.

The DOJ expanding their investigation here. So they're looking into more transactions between Tesla, Musk. And then, also, some of the other companies that are controlled by Musk. So no real impact on the stock, at least for right now.

But this is just another challenge for Musk. A man that doesn't seem to have a lot of extra time, and nor should he, with everything that he has on his plate right now. All the companies that he is running. All the projects, initiatives, that are underway. So this could be a bit of a challenge here, depending on what regulators are able to uncover, and exactly how far this probe potentially goes.

BRAD SMITH: He's still got enough time to tweet. He finds time He makes time to tweet.

SEANA SMITH: 3:00 in the morning. 4:00 in the morning.

BRAD SMITH: Or post, I should say. Are we X-ing now?

SEANA SMITH: I don't know. We're going to figure all that out.
