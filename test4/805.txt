According to Reuters, Tesla TSLA has combined several innovations to make a significant technological advancement that could revolutionize the manufacturing of electric vehicles (EVs) and help Elon Musk reach his goal of halving production costs.

Tesla developed the "gigacasting" method, using massive presses with up to 9,000 tons of pressure, to shape its Model Y's front and rear structures. This innovation dramatically reduced production costs and gave TSLA a competitive edge.To stay ahead, the company is close to a breakthrough, planning to cast an entire EV underbody as a single piece, replacing approximately 400 components typically found in a traditional car.

How Will the Breakthrough Benefit Tesla?

Two of the sources disclosed to Reuters that Tesla's previously undisclosed innovative design and manufacturing techniques could allow the company to develop a car from the ground up in as little as 18-24 months, a significant improvement from the three to four years typically required by most competitors, disrupting the conventional methods of car design and manufacturing.

Not only will the new manufacturing process result in significant cost savings for the EV manufacturer but also increase its capacity to manufacture and deliver a greater number of EVs than its counterparts.

Tesla’s Supercomputer, Dojo, is forecast to fuel the surge in the EV maker’s market capitalization by a notable 76%, boosting its valuation by nearly $600 billion. Also, Morgan Stanley upgraded its assessment of Tesla's stock from "equal-weight" to "overweight" and designated it as its "top pick,” estimating the world’s largest EV manufacturer to hit the target of $400, surging nearly 60% from its current price levels within 12-18 months (Read: Tesla's Supercomputer Dojo Propels These ETFs).
