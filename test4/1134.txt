If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) so let's look a bit deeper.

Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?

For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Tesla is:

Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) รท (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)

0.16 = US$11b รท (US$94b - US$27b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).

Thus, Tesla has an ROCE of 16%. In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Auto industry average of 9.6% it's much better.

So How Is Tesla's ROCE Trending?

We're delighted to see that Tesla is reaping rewards from its investments and is now generating some pre-tax profits. About five years ago the company was generating losses but things have turned around because it's now earning 16% on its capital. And unsurprisingly, like most companies trying to break into the black, Tesla is utilizing 245% more capital than it was five years ago. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, both common traits of a multi-bagger.
