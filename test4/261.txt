The electric carmaker’s market cap is nearing $750bn as investors amp up excitement. Watts the buzz about?
• Tesla is on the run again. The Elon Musk-led EV giant saw its stock advance nearly 5% on Thursday on news that as many as 375,000 Cybertrucks may be produced a year – more than the 100,000 anticipated by analysts. Further, rumors for a planned Gigafactory in Spain helped send the stock another 5% in after-hours trading.
• Is Tesla stock back at the electrifying returns? After closing its 10th straight session in the green yesterday, the EV maker is drawing closer to a $750bn market cap. Refresher: Tesla was the first automaker in history to cross the $1tn valuation mark. Then the wheels fell off and the EV kingpin lost 72% of its worth.
• Tesla stock, a crown jewel in the Reddit stocks corner, stays true to its retail-inspired trading and frolic behavior. Shares are up 13% in June alone, and more than 110% for the year. But the stock is still some 40% away from its all-time high of $410 a share.
