Electric vehicle company Tesla Inc TSLA completed its first deliveries of the highly anticipated Cybertruck pickup truck at the end of November.

One of the first people to take delivery was Reddit co-founder and investor Alexis Ohanian. Here's what Ohanian had to say about the truck and why his wife Serena Williams is distancing herself.

What Happened: First unveiled in November 2019, the Cybertruck has been one of the most talked about vehicle launches in years.

Ohanian was one of the first people to take delivery of the truck, securing a Cybertruck at the launch event.

In a recent interview, Ohanian shared his early praise for the Cybertruck. "Handles even better than my (Tesla) X, feels like I'm driving the APC (armored personnel carrier) from Aliens, plenty of room for my two kids/my two 100lb dogs. Love it," he told The Verge.

Ohanian has repeatedly likened the Cybertruck to the APC, a fictional vehicle from the 1986 movie “Aliens,” drawing parallels between the two on various occasions.

"As a big fella, this is the first car that really feels comfortable to me," Ohanian, who is 6'5", added.

In previous remarks about the Cybertruck, Ohanian has praised the vehicle’s scent, its auditory experience, and its smooth performance. He has noted that his Cybertruck has been named "Cerbeus," which is the beast owned by Hades in Greek mythology.

The Reddit co-founder said his Cybertruck is a Foundation Series model and the third vehicle delivered by Tesla.

Why It's Important: Ohanian shared on social media platform Twitter, now known as X, that he was "thrilled" to be one of the first owners of a Cybertruck. The investor said he received a call from Tesla CEO Elon Musk's chief of staff to ask if he wanted to be one of the first owners.

He’s shared many photos and a video of the Cybertruck on his Twitter. "I am gonna be the coolest dad dropping my daughter off at school."

While Ohanian loves the Cybertruck, his wife and tennis legend Serena Williams may not be in love with the vehicle and the attention that has come along with it.

Williams was spotted riding in the Cybertruck recently, which may have prompted a post on social media from the tennis star.

"Don't be mistaken, I ride with my @lincoln family…in all stages of my life," Williams posted on her Instagram Monday.

Williams included several photos in the post, including one of Ohanian with their Lincoln vehicle.

Since 2018, Williams has been a brand ambassador for Lincoln, an automotive company owned by Ford Motor Company F, and she has been featured in commercials for Lincoln.

The new Cybertruck is loved by Ohanian, but could intensify an ongoing rivalry between Ford and Tesla with the Ohanian/Williams house potentially being divided.
