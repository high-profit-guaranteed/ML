Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock rose 5.59% (As on March 26, 11:26:19 AM UTC-4, Source: Google Finance) after Mizuho downgraded Tesla (TSLA) to Neutral from Buy with a $195 price target. The firm remains constructive on the broader electric vehicle landscape with the long-term trend to electrification, but says near-term electric vehicle demand and tightening liquidity are creating challenges into 2025. Mizuho also downgraded Rivian (RIVN) and Nio (NIO) to Neutral from Buy, citing slowing demand and increasing inventory. “While we remain constructive on the broader EV landscape with the LT trend to electrification, near-term EV demand and tightening liquidity are creating challenges into 2025E,” analysts said. Mizuho now anticipates approximately 15% year-over-year growth for the EV market in 2024, compared to their previous estimate of 25% and against IHS’s forecast of roughly 33%. For 2025, they project a 17% increase, while IHS predicts a 34% rise.

They cite several reasons for this adjustment, including EV inventories being double those of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, diminished consumer affordability due to auto pricing surging by about 30% over the past three years—significantly higher than the long-term compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5%. Tesla has struggled in the first quarter, with weakness in all its major regions. It’s reportedly cut production at its Shanghai plant, even with multiple suspension at its Berlin facility.

However, it will almost certainly regain its BEV crown, at least briefly, in the first quarter. That’s because BYD’s sales have plunged in January-February amid typically weak China demand amid Lunar New Year holidays, and as consumers waited for price cuts and new models.

Moreover, analysts point to cuts in EV subsidies in the US and EU, and price wars in the Chinese EV market as contributing factors to their revised outlook. For TSLA, Mizuho has lowered its price target from $270 to $195. RIVN saw its target cut from $24 to $12, and for NIO, analysts reduced the price objective from $15 to $5.5. However, Rivian is well-positioned for growth in a few years down the road as they have started out with the R1S and the R1T. So that’s the SUV and the truck, which are pretty expensive.

Meanwhile, in the fourth quarter, the company had produced approximately 495,000 vehicles and delivered over 484,000 vehicles. In 2023, vehicle deliveries grew 38% YoY to 1.81 million while production grew 35% YoY to 1.85 million.
