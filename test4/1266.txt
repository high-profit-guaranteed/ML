Hyderabad: The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) intensified its November 30 election campaign, with party chief Asaddudin Owaisi taking part in a door-to-door campaign and meeting voters.

As Owaisi entered Amanagar in Yakutpura, where Miraj Jaffar Hussain is contesting, residents greeted him with garlands and rose petals and lined up to hear the Sadar's (party president) voice. He shook hands with the youths and inquired about their problems.

Elderly women who were preparing food ran out to bless him.

"The MIM has selected Miraj Jaffar Hussain. We are with AIMIM, as the party has been resolving our issues for the last few years," said Nafiza Begum, a senior citizen of Amanagar said.

A visually impaired elderly woman told Owaisi said that she and all her family had voted for Salar-e-Millat — his father Sultan Salauddin Owaisi — and would continue to vote for the Majlis.

Owaisi told the residents: “Hame Aap Sab ki Dua Chahiye (give us your blessings)” and “Meharbani se Apna Vote AIMIM ko Daley, Ham Hamesha Aap ke Saath Rahenge aur Inshallah Rehange (Vote for the AIMIM, we will be at your service.”

Owaisi then went to Rajendrangar and conducted a padayatra in support of party candidate M. Swami Goud and was similarly greeted with enthusiasm and pro-MIM slogans. An elderly woman, visually challenged, said she knew the MIM symbol and would support the party. Special 'duas' were performed by the residents of Hassanagar.

Owaisi has covered most localities in the nine constituencies where the AIMIM has fielded candidates.

He was accompanied by MIM MIC Mirza Rahmath Baig Qadri, Swami Yadav and Mohd Nawazuddin, Suleimannagar corporator, Habeeb Zain Arif, ex-corporator, Ibtedayee Majalis.
