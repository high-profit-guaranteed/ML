The EV maker is desperately trying to catch up in the competitive Chinese market as it slashed prices for the second time in less than a week.
• Tesla stock fell 3.2% on Wednesday after the Elon Musk-run EV company announced its second round of price cuts in China in less than a week. The starting prices of select Model Y and Model X versions just got about $2,000 cheaper for Chinese buyers, or a reduction of up to 6.9%.
• Fierce competition is looming in the Chinese EV market. Tesla’s domestic rival, Warren Buffett-backed BYD, is taking the lead as the country’s largest automaker by sales. Other notable EV manufacturers in China include state-owned SAIC, SAIC-owned MG Motor, and Great Wall Motor – all have significantly lowered prices across models this year.
• China’s auto industry has shown signs of slowing growth, prompting EV brands to aggressively reduce prices and trim their profit margins in efforts to attract hard-to-get customers. All that price slashing will inevitably show up in the top and bottom line of EV makers this quarter. Skewed profit margins = better deals for customers!
