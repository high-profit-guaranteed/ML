Tesla Inc. shipped 435,059 cars globally in the third quarter, as factory downtime led to its first quarterly delivery decline in more than a year.

The results, posted Monday, missed expectations. Several Wall Street analysts had slashed their delivery estimates in recent days, and the consensus compiled by Bloomberg fell to 456,722 as of Friday. Tesla delivered 466,140 cars in the second quarter.
