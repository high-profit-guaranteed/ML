The auto market has been experiencing significant growth worldwide due to the increasing demand for high-end passenger vehicles and electric vehicles. However, fluctuating raw material prices and the mutualization of premium cars might hinder industry growth. While Li Auto Inc. (LI) could be kept on hold, I think Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) and Nikola Corporation (NKLA) might be best avoided for reasons discussed in this article.

Increasing demand for high-end passenger vehicles, urbanization and rising infrastructure spending in the economy are driving the automotive market growth. The industrial sector is increasing, particularly in emerging nations, creating jobs in industries such as building, mining, and tourism.

The automotive industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.9% until 2030.

Moreover, the latest Canalys research predicts the global EV market will grow by 27.1% in 2024, hitting 17.5 million units. The shift toward electric and driverless vehicles is expected to propel the automobile sector forward in the next few years. This trend is further fueled by favorable government regulations, automaker commitments to EVs, and increased concerns about climate change.

However, the market faces various challenges, such as fluctuating raw material prices and the need to comply with various international standards and regulations. Also, the mutualization of premium cars or vehicles which are equipped with the advanced technologies is extremely difficult at times due to which the market growth might be hampered in the coming years.
