LVMH is closing in on Tesla Inc. for ninth spot on the list of the world’s biggest companies by market capitalization, only days after entering the top 10.

Shares in the luxury-goods behemoth have risen 6.9% this month, lifting its market value to about $500 billion, helped by stronger-than-expected first-quarter sales. Tesla has fallen 23% in the same time, cutting its capitalization to $505 billion as price cuts take a toll on the electric carmaker’s profitability.
