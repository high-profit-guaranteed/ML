A new SEC filing shows Elon Musk increased his ownership of Tesla (TSLA) to 20.5%, drawing him ever closer to his goal of having a 25% voting stake in the company. It's been a wild 2024 so far for the EV maker, with its shares under pressure and Musk's massive $56 billion Tesla pay package struck down by a Delaware court, prompting him to discuss moving the company's incorporation to Texas.

Westly Group Founder and Managing Partner, and former Tesla board member, Steve Westly join Yahoo Finance to discuss Musk, his leadership of Tesla, the company's performance, and why he believes it will have a tough time in 2024.

Westly comments on what Musk and Tesla need to focus on for 2024: "They need to scramble to find the next growth wave, $25,000 car, at least 18 months out, that may be a game changer, might get them back to 30 or 40% growth. What are you going to do in the next 18 months? And I think they've got three shots on goal. They've got the self-driving vehicle with robotaxis. Probably still three five years out. They've got an energy division which most people don't even think about, and that is doing $6 billion last year on the way to maybe $8 or $9 billion this year, growing 50%. That could be a $20 billion division and then they've got the global charging network, because everybody has basically thrown up the white flag, signed a deal with Tesla to be able to use their global charging network. They've got to make one of these three things to work to get the growth cycle back."

JOHS LIPTON: Elon Musk increasing his ownership in Tesla just over 20% from his last reported stake of 13% in May, getting him closer-- much closer to his goal of owning a quarter of the company. While he's come under fire for wanting more control, Musk is getting support from ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood. Here's what she told us last week.

CATHIE WOOD: Elon Musk is the inventor of our age. And he is also our Renaissance man. So I'm always surprised at the pushback he receives. And I do think that 25, he's not asking for any more economic interest. It's voting interest. And for many of our companies, we are supportive of super voting rights because we know the visionary leaders, we go through periods of volatility. And they just need to be able to execute upon their vision, not be thrown off by boards of directors, who are listening to short-term oriented shareholders and swayed by them.

JOHS LIPTON: And joining us now is a former Tesla board member, a former state comptroller of California, and now founder and managing partner of the Westly Group, Steve Westly. Steve, it is good to have you on the show. And maybe I'll just start, Steve, with what you just heard Cathie Wood say. She describing Elon Musk, Steve, as a Renaissance man, inventor of our age. What do you think? Do you agree with that? Is that a fair description in your opinion?

STEVE WESTLY: Well, look, there's no doubt, he's built one of the transform-- transformational companies in the age. And he's done it twice with SpaceX. But there still needs to be appropriate board governance. What's interesting to me is Tesla's just had this extraordinary year. I call it the tale of two cities, where they produced $97 billion in revenue in 2023. They sold 1.8 million cars. That's more EVs than anybody, including BYD last year. They dominate the US market, 55% market share, more than everybody else combined.

And-- but growth is slowing, and everybody can see it. And they need to figure out how quickly they can get to the next growth curve. Right now it looks like they need that $25,000 car up and out into the market as soon as possible. That's going to be Elon Musk best big test. We'll see whether he can meet it.

JULIE HYMAN: Well, and we know historically that he has a lot of balls in the air at once typically, whether it's posting on X or dealing with all of his other companies or whatever other side battles he's choosing to fight at any given moment right now, this struggle to maybe move the company to try to get more voting rights, is that a distraction at a time when, to your point, growth is slowing?

STEVE WESTLY: Look, I think Tesla and Elon need to focus on one thing and only one thing. I think 2024 is going to be rough. They need to scramble to find the next growth rave, $25,000 car, at least 18 months out. That may be a game changer, might get them back to 30% or 40% growth.

What are you going to do in the next 18 months? And I think they got three shots on goal. They've got the self-driving vehicle with robotaxis, probably still three to five years out. They've got an energy division, which most people don't even think about. And that is doing 6 billion last year on the way to maybe 8 or 9 billion this year, growing 50%. That could be a $20 billion division.

And then they've got the global charging network, because everybody has basically thrown up the white flag, if you will, signed a deal with Tesla to be able to use their global charging network. They've got to make one of these three things work to get the growth cycle back. That's what Elon should be evaluated on. That's what the board should be setting his comp on in my opinion. It always needs to be performance based.

JOHS LIPTON: And, Steve, I want to ask you-- switching gears here, a different question. Musk's SpaceX wants to convert its business incorporation to Texas from Delaware, wants to do the same thing with Tesla. Does that move make sense to you, Steve?

STEVE WESTLY: Look, I have no comment on whether they should be in Delaware or Texas. They should be focused on one thing-- moving faster, getting new product into the market that is lower cost, that can compete with BYD, which is clearly far and away, full stop, their number one competitor, all the legal issues, the tax issues, the control issues. Generally speaking, you want to be focused on making a great product at a lower price and doing it faster than anybody else.

Every minute you waste on other stuff, I think, is suboptimal. They've got their work cut out for them. And the Chinese are coming, and they're coming quickly.
