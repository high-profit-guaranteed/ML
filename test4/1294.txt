EV giant Tesla Inc TSLA will hold the delivery event of its much-awaited all-electric Cybertruck at 1 p.m. CT on Thursday at its Gigafactory in Texas.

What Happened: Tesla VP of Investor Relations Martin Viecha took to X on his personal account to clarify the time of the event after noticing that several mistook it for an evening event.

The company has already sent out invites to the retail investors selected to be part of the event. A live stream of the event will be available for those not attending the event in person.

The excitement amongst Tesla enthusiasts is building as the delivery event nears. Tesla has put Cybertrucks on display in several showrooms across the U.S. which have been pulling a significant audience.

Why It Matters: However, while Elon Musk and Tesla have dropped hints about the vehicle now and then, further details pertaining to configuration and pricing continue to be under wraps.

During Tesla's third-quarter earnings call, Musk indicated that the company envisions delivering approximately 250,000 Cybertrucks in a year in the future. However, he cautioned that this target might not be achieved next year.

"I think we’ll probably reach it sometime in 2025. That’s my best guess," Musk then said.

"Special products that come along once in a long while are just incredibly difficult to bring to market, to reach volume, to be prosperous. It’s fundamental to the nature of the newness," he said in October.

According to data from a crowd-sourced online reservation tracker for the Cybertruck, net reservations for the vehicle have now crossed the two million threshold. Reservations hit the one million mark as early as May 2021.
