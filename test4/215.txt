Indonesiaâ€™s largest taxi operator will turn to BYD Co. for 80% of its electric-vehicle fleet while reviewing its Tesla Inc orders as lower-cost models win out in the country.

Most of the 500 EVs to be delivered to PT Blue Bird this year will be filled by BYD, especially the E6 and T3 models, as the vehicles are a better fit for the Indonesian market, said President Director Sigit Priawan Djokosoetono in interview.
