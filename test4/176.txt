NOLENSVILLE – Russell McWhirter has coached with an added purpose this season, his first as MBA's head lacrosse coach.

McWhirter, a 2002 MBA graduate, has coached for the man he played for — longtime assistantChrisSmith, who died in October after a lengthy battle with cancer — throughout his inaugural year. McWhirter led the Big Red to its second TSLA Division 2 Class AAA state championship in three years Saturday, beating McCallie 9-7 at Nolensville High.

"He was my coach and kind of my mentor," McWhirter said. "He's the reason I am where I am today. He was a wonderful guy.

"He coached lacrosse for about 22 years. He was the defensive coordinator. We called him the Godfather because he did everything. He got our youth leagues up and running. I'm a defensive guy through and though because of him. I played for him."

McWhirter's defense did enough to derail McCallie, which beat MBA 11-10 in three overtimes in the regular season.

"It was a thriller," MBA junior Trey Woodcock said. "We knew we had that a game the first time. We had a few mistakes here and there. We corrected them and came out with a W."

Woodcock finished with three goals for the Big Red and freshman teammate Cade Sturdivant had four assists to finished with a team-high 33 assists. Woodcock finished the season with a team-high 47 goals.

McWhirter called Sturdivant his most experienced player despite being a freshman. He said Sturdivant finds games to play even when the Big Red don't have a contest scheduled.

Sturdivant's four assists were the third-most he's had in a game this season. He had seven against Loveland (Ohio) and five against Briarcrest.

"It' usually been a mix of assists and goals," Sturdivant said. "But I'll help this team however I can. We're a solid team. We have a lot of people that have a lot of heart and I think that's what did it for us."

Woodcock watched MBA win a championship in 2021 from the stands. He wasn't on the varsity roster.

"There was a lot of compassion even then from the stands," Woodcock said. "I just wanted to compete for MBA."
