In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 best EV stocks to buy in 2024. If you want to skip our introduction to the electric vehicle market and the latest news, then you can take a look at the 5 Best EV Stocks To Buy in 2024.

If there's one thing that can be said with certainty as well as settle into 2024, it's that the electric vehicle industry is a changed sector. Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine took place in 2022, the clean energy sector that's led by electric vehicle firms such as Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), was an investor darling. Money, helped by record low interest rates, was piling into the sector as investors rushed to get an early spot inside the world's attempt to shift away from sooty fossil fuels into the new era of clean and renewable energy.

However, since the invasion started, global macroeconomic conditions have meant that high growth and high risk sectors such as electric vehicle stocks are now facing an environment they haven't contended with before. Higher rates mean that investors demand more bang for the buck for their money, and EV stocks such as Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) are left at a disadvantage since they are in the early stages of their business expansion and therefore find it difficult to rake in bottom line profits. In fact, Lucid's shares are down by 62% over the past year as the luxury electric vehicle manufacturer finds itself facing the same set of manufacturing and production problems that Tesla had to face as it valiantly attempted to scale up production.

While we'll get into some of the problems that electric vehicle stocks are facing in a bit, their turmoil aren't helped by the fact that consumers are growing wary of cars of a new kind that are still quite young when we consider the established nature of the internal combustion automobile industry. These problems were evident in a bombshell report by Consumer Reports that surveyed more than a quarter of a million EV users and found that vehicles, especially those that were launched over the past three years faced a stunning 79% more problems than a traditional car.

So, what's troubling EV stocks these days? Well, the tighter financial conditions since the Russian invasion mean that consumers find it more difficult to finance pricey EV purchases, right at the time when car manufacturers have invested billions of dollars of capital in an industry that many believe does not have an upward limit to its demand. This was evident during the latest earnings call of the U.S. automotive giant General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), where management outlined that not only had EV demand slowed down, but that the firm might have to re divert resources back to making conventional cars.

Talking about automotive giants, no analysis of the electric vehicle industry would be complete without looking at what the world's most valuable EV stock Tesla has been up to. These days, Tesla is embroiled in a fresh bout of controversy that has seen its chief Elon Musk vow to move the firm's incorporation out of Delaware after he was stripped of a massive $65 billion pay package. However, industry insiders believe that despite Musk rapidly calling for a vote to decide matters after he was denied the pay package, Tesla is yet to set the date for a shareholder vote since its board might not be adequately independent of Musk. When it comes to watching EV stocks, this particular news bite could very well prove to be a major catalyst (or otherwise) for Tesla's shares.

With these details in mind, let's take a look at the best EV stocks to buy in 2024. Some notable names are Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM).
