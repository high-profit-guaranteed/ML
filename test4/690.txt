Tesla Inc TSLA CEO Elon Musk has further stoked anticipation for the test drive of version 12 of its full self-driving software. He had previously said the drive would be live-streamed on his social media platform X, formerly Twitter.

What Happened: "Tomorrow around 4 pm PT," Musk wrote. He was responding to an X.com user enquiring about the time of the livestream. Musk had said less than 24 hours ago that maybe he could squeeze some time for the livestream the next day night.

However, X.com users gave confused reactions to Musk's reply as they tried to decipher if the CEO meant Friday or Saturday, given that his reply came minutes after the clock struck midnight in PT.

The live stream of the test drive of version 12 was first teased by Musk last week on Monday during the peak Musk-Zuckerberg drama. Musk posted on Monday that he will ask the Tesla car to drive to Mark Zuckerberg's house for the FSD test drive, and the much-awaited fight will ensue if the Meta CEO opens his door.

However, neither the Musk-Zuckerberg fight nor the live-streaming of the FSD test drive happened.

Why It Matters: In June, Musk said that version 12 would no longer be beta, hinting that it would achieve full autonomy by then. FSD is now in beta mode, meaning it is still being tested and requires active driver supervision.

During the 2023 World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai in July, Musk also said that Tesla is "very close" to achieving full self-driving capability.

"I have been wrong about this prediction in the past, but I feel we are closer to it than we ever have been," Musk said.
