Exchange-traded funds offering investors betting on or against Tesla Inc. two times the returns of the volatile stock launched Thursday, after what seemed like a long-shot bid at winning regulatory approval.

The T-Rex 2X Long Tesla Daily Target ETF, (ticker TSLT) uses derivatives to track twice the daily returns of Elon Musk â€™s electric-vehicle maker while the T-Rex 2X Inverse Tesla Daily Target ETF (TSLZ) seeks to deliver the opposite return of the stock by the same magnitude.
