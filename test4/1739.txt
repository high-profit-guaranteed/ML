Tesla Inc. picked a location in the upscale Parque Arauco mall in Santiago to open this month its first store in the country, according to a marketing email sent to clients and replicated on several X accounts. This will also be the carmaker’s first dealership in South America.

The company registered the name Tesla Chile SpA in September. The unit can carry out activities such as the sale and fabrication of cars and those related to “generation of energy and electricity.” The electric-vehicle maker was also recruiting for positions in the capital Santiago, including for a country manager. Three LinkedIn positions remain open.
