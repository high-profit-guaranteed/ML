• Tesla is up more than 10% today on a boost from Morgan Stanley analysts.
• The analysts claim that Tesla's Dojo supercomputer could add $500 billion to the company's value.
• The Dojo supercomputer is an in-house AI trainer that's being used to further development of the complete self-driving car initiative, amongst other things.

Tesla (TSLA) was up big on Monday, after Morgan Stanley analysts stated that the Dojo supercomputer initiative could boost the company's value by $500 billion. The stock had a gain as high as $26.35, or 10.6% based on the previous day's close. The analysts compared the supercomputer's potential to be as potent as the Amazon (AMZN) Amazon Web Services (AWS) division has been for the company's overall success.

The Dojo supercomputer's capability to boost Tesla's brand well beyond selling cars is a big argument bump to the investors that believe Tesla is more than just a car company—it's starting to prove that it can branch out into many different sectors with this analysis.

Tesla is set to announce earnings in October of this year, and it could result in some stock price chop, given its inability to break through expectations for the past four quarters.

The popular EV stock has missed revenue expectations three out of the last four quarters and beat revenue expectations by 0.81% in this past earnings announcement.

Tesla beat earnings-per-share (EPS) expectations in three out of the last four quarters though, with the last earnings report boasting an 11.12% beat relative to expectations.

The options market is pricing in a +-$35.33 expected stock price moves in the earnings announcement cycle, based on current implied volatility.

With an expected move well over 10% of the stock price, the market is projecting a fair amount of fireworks to be seen from this upcoming earnings announcement.

Pair that with the fact that the expected move through the December 2023 options cycle is only $52.32, about 17 points more over a much longer period, all eyes will be on TSLA stock in just over a month when it releases quarterly earnings.
