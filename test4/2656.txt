Good Morning Traders! In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.

Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.

We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis:

The SPY ETF SPY is trading around the significant level of 520.67. For those looking to take a bullish stance, the initial target is 521.85. A strong performance above this level could lead to further upward movement towards 523.76, which serves as a crucial support. Achieving stability above this support sets the stage for a potential climb to 525.26.

Should the bullish momentum persist, the ultimate target for the day is set at 526.31. This level represents the pinnacle of today's potential upward trajectory for the SPY, contingent on maintaining the momentum beyond 525.26 during regular market hours.

On the flip side, if the SPY fails to maintain support at 520.67, the bears might gain the upper hand, driving the price towards 519.71. A noticeable presence of sellers at this level could lead to a further decline to 518.76. Breaking past this level with significant selling pressure might bring the ETF down to a solid support level at 518.04.

In the event of an intense sell-off, the bearish objective for the day is pegged at 517.39. This level is the ultimate target for bears, assuming a continued downward trajectory through the previously mentioned support levels.

The QQQ ETF QQQ is navigating around the pivotal 446.51 mark. For a bullish scenario to unfold, it's essential for buyers to maintain prices above this level. Succeeding in this could lead to the establishment of 447.73 as a firm support point. If the buying pressure sustains, the next level of interest is 449.36, potentially paving the way to higher prices.

Should the bullish trend continue, the peak target for today's session is envisioned at 452.14. This target is achievable if the ETF manages to break past 450.98, supported by strong buying interest throughout the trading day.

Conversely, if the QQQ struggles to stay above 446.51, the bearish players might take control, pushing the price down to 445.43. A confirmation of weakness at this level could lead to further downside testing at 444.09. Persistent selling pressure could challenge the support at 442.53.

If the bears continue to dominate, the day's lowest bearish target is set at 441.56. This level represents the floor for today's potential decline, assuming the selling momentum breaches through the aforementioned supports.

Apple's AAPL stock is currently positioned around 170.32. Bulls are eyeing 171.13 as the next support level, with hopes to propel the stock towards 171.79. Sustaining bullish energy could lead to a test of 172.45, setting the stage for further gains.

If the bullish trend remains intact, the ultimate goal for Apple today is reaching 172.95. This target hinges on the stock's ability to maintain upward momentum and break past intermediate resistance levels during the trading session.

If Apple's stock cannot sustain support at 171.13, a bearish shift could emerge, pushing the price back to 170.32. Further selling might lead the stock to explore lower levels at 169.73. If the selling intensifies, 168.99 could come into play as the next critical point.

In a scenario of continued bearish pressure, the lowest target for the day is envisioned at 168.41. This level represents the bearish extremity, assuming a breakdown through the key supports mentioned.

Microsoft MSFT is trading near 422.84, with bullish prospects hinging on maintaining levels above this point. A successful hold could lead to a rally towards 423.81, which needs to be established as a firm support during the day. Overcoming this barrier could open the path to 425.16, signaling a continuation of bullish momentum.

The highest bullish aim for Microsoft today is 426.00. Achieving this level would require a sustained bullish drive beyond 425.16, accompanied by robust buying interest.

On the contrary, if Microsoft cannot find support at 422.84, a downward movement could be initiated towards 421.62. Breaking this level could signal a deeper bearish trend, pushing the stock to test 420.26. Continued pressure from the bears could lead to a descent to 419.17.

The bearish endpoint for today is set at 417.25. This level serves as the ultimate bearish target, contingent upon a successive breach of the aforementioned support levels.

NVIDIA NVDA is currently at a crucial juncture of 928.47. Bulls are looking to drive the price towards 937.84, aiming to establish it as a new base of support. If the bullish sentiment holds, the next target is 945.15, with an eye on further advances.

The top bullish target for NVIDIA today is 955.43. This level is attainable if the momentum remains positive and the stock manages to surpass intermediate targets, particularly 950.29, during the trading day.

Conversely, if NVIDIA's stock cannot maintain the 928.47 level as support, we might witness a bearish push towards 922.67. Should this level falter under selling pressure, the next focus shifts to 917.98. A continued bearish sentiment could further challenge the support at 913.30.

Should the sell-off intensify, the lowest target for NVIDIA today is envisioned at 907.51. This level represents the bearish limit, assuming a continuous downward trajectory through the key support levels mentioned.

Alphabet's GOOGL stock is trading at 151.24, with bulls aiming to keep the price above this level to initiate a move towards 152.27. Maintaining this momentum could lead to a challenge of the high bull target of 152.94, marking the pinnacle of today's bullish expectations for Alphabet.

However, if the stock fails to hold 151.24 as support, it may signal an opportunity for bears to drive the price down to 150.41. A breach here could open the way to 149.58, with a focus on further declines.

In a scenario of pronounced selling, the day's bearish endpoint for Alphabet is set at 148.95. This target is indicative of a significant bearish move, contingent on breaking through the aforementioned support levels.

Meta Platforms META is seen at 498.03, with bulls seeking to solidify this level as support to pave the way for a rally to 508.25. If the bullish drive persists, the stock could be pushed towards 512.85, setting the stage for further advances.

The highest bullish target for Meta today is 515.39. This level is achievable with continued bullish momentum and a clear break above the intermediate resistance levels.

Conversely, if Meta fails to maintain support at 504.54, it could indicate a shift towards bearish sentiment, pushing the stock down to 500.83. A further decline could lead to a retest of 498.03. If bearish forces prevail, the stock might explore lower levels.

The lowest bearish target for Meta today is 495.54. This level marks the floor for potential declines, assuming a sustained bearish push through the critical support levels.

Tesla TSLA is hovering around the key level of 179.79. Bulls are eyeing an upward move towards 182.53, with sustained buying potentially leading to further gains, notably at the 184.10 mark. A bullish rally in the broader market could enhance Tesla's prospects of reaching higher targets.

The ultimate bullish target for Tesla today is 189.22. This level represents the apex of potential gains, assuming a strong buying interest and a favorable market environment.

If Tesla's stock cannot hold the 179.79 level, a bearish scenario might unfold, taking the price down to 176.34. Continued selling could exacerbate the decline, bringing 172.61 into focus. A breach here could indicate a deeper sell-off.

The bearish culmination point for Tesla today is set at 169.70. This target suggests a significant downside potential, contingent on the stock navigating through the earlier mentioned support levels under heavy selling pressure.

Final Word: Today's trading environment is relatively calm in terms of data releases, with the spotlight on the Trade Balance revisions due at 10 AM EST. The focus will also be on Treasury auctions, particularly the 2 Year FRN (Floating Rate Note) and the 7 Year Note Auctions, which could influence large positional trades. As the quarter-end rebalance approaches, it's crucial to monitor volume and market dynamics closely. Good luck with your trading today!

In the afternoon, at 1 PM EST, attention will turn to the Treasury as it conducts an auction for 5-Year Notes, an event that could influence bond markets and, by extension, equity markets. Although no Federal Reserve speakers are scheduled for today, the amalgamation of data releases is likely to stir market movements. Traders are advised to approach the day with discipline, keeping an eye on these data releases as they can significantly impact market dynamics. Wishing everyone a disciplined and successful trading day!
