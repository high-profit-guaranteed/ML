Tesla has for many years led the way in electric car sales worldwide.

To buy Tesla shares online from Australia, you will have to find a broker that offers access to US markets.

Fortunately, there are a number to choose from, and many will offer different features, including:

A big plus of buying US shares is the opportunity to purchase fractional shares. This means that instead of buying the full share, you can buy just a part of it. This is particularly helpful when you are dealing in shares such as Tesla, which do not come cheap.

Another bonus of using a platform that trades is US stocks is the opportunity for commission-free trading. Some online brokers offer this feature and it can save you plenty of money.

Some platforms are quite complicated, with a host of products and options available. Platforms that are easy to navigate are generally the way to go.

Look for a platform that has a solid research and reporting section that can give you important information about Tesla, including company overview, price history, recommendations and price forecasts.

After choosing your broker, it is time to deposit money into your brokerage account. Be warned that these funds might not clear immediately, so you can't rush into any purchase.

Step 3: Decide how much you want to invest

As mentioned above, you don't have to worry about the expense of a full Tesla share – you can instead buy a fractional share. If the value of one share expands, the same is true even for a fraction, so you can still easily see profits and at a smaller risk.

If the price does drop this makes it easier to purchase even more stock and lowers the average price you have paid.

Instead of buying shares, it might be worth looking into an Exchange-Traded Fund. This is basically a mutual fund that can be traded as easily as shares, allowing for a more diverse portfolio.

ETFs are a ‘basket’ of shares and bonds, which you can invest in like any other share. However, the yields may not be as high as individual stocks and not as exciting as share investing if you are an active trader.

ETFs such as Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), and ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (ARKQ) all have exposure to Tesla.

You can configure your order to protect your position. These are some popular options.

A market order is the most simple, being executed at whatever the market price is the moment it is made.

Remember that in fast-moving markets, these prices can change while you're making the trade, so they can be slightly different to what you wanted. Let’s say you search for Tesla shares and they are trading at US$610. You place an order but by the time it executes the share price has dropped to US$600. That is the price you will pay.

With a buy limit order, your trade will only execute when the share price reaches the price, or lower, that you nominate. Let’s say you decide you only want to buy Tesla shares at US$600 or lower. Once the price drops to $600, your limit order will kick in.

This is when you nominate a price at which to sell your shares. When that price is reached, your sell order is executed. For example, you decide you want to sell your Tesla shares at US$610. Once the price reaches US$610, the stop limit executes.

This helps you reduce risk. With a stop loss order, you nominate a price at which you decide to sell your shares. If the share price drops a lot, for example, the stop loss means you sell out before your shareholding suffers too much damage.

Once you've made all your choices, it's time to place your order. Open your trading platform, type in the Tesla share code (NASDAQ: TSLA) and execute the order you want. This is usually as easy as clicking a button.
