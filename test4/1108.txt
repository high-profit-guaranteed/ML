Cybertruck fans got an exciting glimpse of the Tesla Inc TSLA Cybertruck's front trunk.

The so-called "frunk" has an automatic closing feature. It has also become a popular feature among electric vehicles (EVs).

As shared by Electrek, Tesla's design for the Cybertruck frunk aims to optimize this extra space, providing an enclosed cargo area in addition to the truck's large open bed in the back.



 Having a secondary cargo area in a truck could prove especially beneficial. Users hauling building materials in the truck bed could use the frunk for storing items that they want to keep cleaner or shielded from potential damage from heavier loads. Interestingly, the sighting revealed interior lighting within the frunk — one light on each side — and the Cybertruck logo prominently displayed in a cyberpunk-like font. It seems there are no Tesla logos on this truck at all.

Among the handful of electric pickups in the market, frunks have varied widely in size. The Tesla Cybertruck's frunk, although not perhaps as deep as some had hoped, appears adequately sized. It could probably accommodate two large pieces of luggage or even a set of golf clubs.
