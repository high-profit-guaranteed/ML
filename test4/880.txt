The lawyer representing victims of a fatal crash of a Tesla Model 3 car in his opening statement in court on Thursday blamed the company's Autopilot driver assistant system, saying that "a car company should never sell consumers experimental vehicles."

An attorney for Tesla , in the first U.S. trial over allegations that its Autopilot feature led to a death, however, said the crash was the result of "a classic human error."

The trial, in a California state court, stems from a civil lawsuit alleging the Autopilot system caused owner Micah Lee's Model 3 to suddenly veer off a highway east of Los Angeles at 65 miles per hour, or 105 kph, strike a palm tree and burst into flames, all in the span of seconds.

The 2019 crash killed Lee and seriously injured his two passengers, including an 8-year-old boy who was disemboweled, according to court documents. The lawsuit, filed against Tesla by the passengers and Lee's estate, accuses Tesla of knowing that Autopilot and other safety systems were defective when it sold the car.

Tesla said its Autopilot driver assistant system is not designed to make a sharp turn on a highway, as it defended the system's safety.
