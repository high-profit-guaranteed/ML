Since 1989, “The Simpsons” has been one of the biggest animated comedies around the world. The series has provided endless references to pop culture and current world events.

The animated comedy has also been known to predict major world events.

Over the course of the series, many actors, musicians, athletes and celebrities have also appeared on the show, including Elon Musk.

What Happened: The world’s richest man today with a wealth of more than $220 billion, Musk has made appearances as himself in several films and television shows and also hosted an infamous episode of “Saturday Night Live” where he referenced electric vehicles, the space industry and his favorite cryptocurrency: Dogecoin.

Among the television series that have featured Musk is “The Simpsons,” in which the Tesla Inc TSLA CEO portrayed himself.

In 2015, Musk was in episode 564 titled, “The Musk Who Fell to Earth,” which aired on Fox, a unit of Fox Corp FOX.

In the episode, Musk moves to Springfield and becomes friends with Homer Simpson. The two revolutionize the town’s nuclear power plant, much to the dismay of Simpson’s boss, Mr. Burns.

Mr. Burns tries to assassinate Musk in the episode, but instead nearly kills Homer, who is saved by Musk.

The episode features Musk arriving in town in a spacecraft that looks like a SpaceX Dragon capsule. References to Hyperloop and self-driving vehicles are also made in the episode.

Musk explains he can’t be friends with Homer anymore and must depart. Elon gifted the Simpsons family a futuristic birdhouse that featured the words “Home Tweet Home,” which may have predicted Musk’s latter acquisition of social media platform Twitter, now called X.

The wording on the birdhouse was not lost on Musk, who said “Simpson’s predicts I buy Twitter S26E12.”

“The Musk Who Fell to Earth” was episode number 12 in season 26 and aired on Fox on Jan. 25, 2015.

While Musk didn’t appear in more "The Simpsons" episodes, the electric vehicle has seen several later appearances. A 2020 episode featured a Tesla Roadster vehicle. Tesla was also featured in two episodes that aired in October 2022, which showcased the Tesla Cybertruck and Tesla Model X vehicles.

Musk also voiced himself on episodes of the animated comedy “South Park.”
