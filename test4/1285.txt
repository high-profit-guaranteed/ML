Martin Viecha, the Head of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) Investor Relations (IR), has shared crucial insights regarding the upcoming first delivery event for the Cybertruck.

This event, scheduled to take place at Gigafactory Texas on Thursday, November 30, 2023, will differ from previous Tesla gatherings like the Cyber Rodeo, with the most notable difference being the event’s start time.

According to Viecha, the Tesla Cybertruck delivery event is set to begin at 1PM CT. There is widespread anticipation for a potential live stream of the event by Tesla, although specifics about the timing of the livestream's launch have not been disclosed.

“The Cybertruck delivery event starts at around 1 p.m. CT on Thursday, in case someone’s unsure. I’ve noticed that few people thought it’s an evening event,” Viecha posted on the social media platform “X”.

The announcement by the Tesla executive surprised a few supporters on social media, especially considering Tesla's usual practice of holding launch and delivery events in the United States during the evening.

While Tesla did have an initial customer delivery event in the afternoon for the Model 3 at Giga Shanghai, such timing was specific to China, not the United States, where vehicles like the Model Y and Model 3 had their first deliveries at night.

Shares of TSLA are down 0.97% in early trading Monday morning.
