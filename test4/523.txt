Why It's Important: GM is a distant second to Tesla in the U.S. electric vehicle market but the company has adopted an all-out strategy on transitioning to EVs. The company has exposure to autonomous driving technology through its Cruise subsidiary. Cruise develops autonomous car technology and is testing a robotaxi service.

Incidentally, much of Ark’s future valuation of Tesla is premised on the EV pioneer’s yet-to-be-launched robotaxi service.

GM ended Thursday’s session up 0.08% at $39.26, while Tesla plunged 9.74% to $262.90, according to Benzinga Pro data.
