With the Cybertruck delivery date of Nov. 30 fast approaching, many are eager to learn more about the Tesla Inc TSLA vehicle. Not only is it bulletproof, but on Joe Rogan's podcast, it was proved to be arrow-proof as well.

Now a new drone video by Joe Tegtmeyer, who often flies over Gigafactory Texas collecting footage showed the Cybertruck can crab-walk. This ability allowed the vehicle to move diagonally versus just moving straight or turning. This feature was also seen in the General Motors Co GM Hummer EV.

Many things are still unknown about the Cybertruck including price, driving range and who exactly will take delivery at the EV's debut later this month, where hopefully all will be revealed.
