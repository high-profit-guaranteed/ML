Morgan Stanley investment strategists led by Denny Galindo made a series of changes to the bank’s U.S. All Cap Growth Model Portfolio.

While the bank added a position in Block (NYSE: SQ) and increased its exposure to Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL), it also slashed its position in electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA).

Morgan Stanley explained the move “as higher rates and competition weigh on car prices and operating margins” of Tesla.

Last month, Tesla said its total operating margin stood at 7.6% in Q3, down significantly from the year-ago quarter’s figure of 17.2%.

Since Morgan Stanley investment strategists added TSLA stock to this portfolio in early 2021, the stock fell about 9%. As a result, the bank is reducing exposure “after poor performance in

the Model.”

“Given TSLA’s volatile nature, we would rather add exposure to other volatile names with fewer nearterm headwinds,” Galindo wrote.
