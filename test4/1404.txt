Tesla's TSLA new Cybertruck, an electric pickup, seemingly struggled off-road driving in snow.

What Happened: Attempting to navigate a slight incline, the Cybertruck is seen spinning its tires, unable to gain the necessary traction to free itself. This scene has sparked a flurry of discussions about the vehicle's off-road capabilities.



 As the Tesla Cybertruck battled the snowy conditions, a gas-powered F-150 from Ford Motor Co F came to its aid. The video shows the Ford truck successfully pulling the Cybertruck out of its snowy trap. This unexpected twist highlights the ongoing competition and comparisons between traditional gas-powered trucks and their emerging electric counterparts.

Why It Matters: This incident has put the spotlight on the Tesla Cybertruck's performance in adverse conditions.

"All terrain tires are not winter tires, they won't do well in snow due to the compounds that are made for warmer weather," one commentator noted on YouTube.

Vehicles of all types, whether they're powered by gas, diesel, or electricity can get stuck, while various factors such as the terrain, weather conditions and even the driver's experience play a crucial role in a vehicle's off-road performance.

It also puts Tesla CEO Elon Musk in an awkward light considering the hype surrounding the Cybertruck's recent launch at the Giga Factory in Texas.

"Once in a while, once in a long while, a product comes along that is rare," Musk said, adding, "We'll remember those special moments."
