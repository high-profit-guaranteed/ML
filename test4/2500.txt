Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Inc. TSLA, has hinted at significant improvements to the company’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, specifically the Autopark feature, which is set to roll out next month. This announcement comes in response to a user’s detailed experience with the latest FSD version.

What Happened: A user known as Farzad shared a comprehensive review of Tesla’s FSD v12.3 on X, noting substantial safety enhancements and smoother operation compared to previous iterations. Despite the progress, Farzad pointed out areas needing further refinement, such as parking lot navigation and interactions with hesitant pedestrians.

Musk replied to Farzad’s tweet with a brief comment promising, “Major improvements coming for Summon & Banish (Autopark) next month.”

Why It Matters: Tesla’s FSD technology has been continuously developed, with recent rollouts to non-employee drivers despite earlier statements suggesting a more cautious approach. The latest version, FSD v12, has been described as a beta release, contradicting Musk’s previous implications of a fully autonomous capability.

The FSD software has shown promising results in California, as Musk has reported in his own experiences and reports. However, the CEO has acknowledged the need for further training in diverse weather conditions. Tesla’s commitment to refining FSD is evident in Musk’s boast of navigating through Austin festival crowds without driver interventions.

The anticipation of FSD improvements aligns with Tesla’s broader efforts to enhance autonomous driving technology. As the company continues to test and update its software, the focus remains on balancing innovation, safety, and regulatory compliance.

As of March 15, 2024, Tesla‘s stock closed at $163.57, a slight increase from the previous close of $162.50. Investors continue to closely watch the stock’s performance, especially given the company’s advancements in FSD technology.
