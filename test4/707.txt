Shares of Tesla Inc. are famously among the most-volatile in the market, but one exchange-traded fund issuer reckons it can time its bets on the electric-vehicle maker to amplify gains and cushion declines.

The Simplify Volt TSLA Revolution ETF, which would trade under the ticker TESL, is taking over the $4 million Simplify Volt RoboCar Disruption and Tech ETF (ticker VCAR) as it seeks to home in on Elon Musk’s company, according to a Tuesday regulatory filing . The fund by Simplify Exchange Traded Funds will hold Tesla stock and derivatives — including futures and swap contracts linked to the car-maker — as well as other ETFs “that have returns linked to” the company.
