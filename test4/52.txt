BRAD SMITH: The next half of the call zeros in on Tesla, ticker symbol TSLA. We're going to be tracking the tick by tick after hours, when the earnings report drops. Brad Smith. Brian Sozzi.

BRIAN SOZZI: I am locked in on if Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, is even going to be on this call. It is no guarantee that he will be. But he best better be on this call. I need to know from him how much money Tesla made during a quarter where they've been slashing prices so people buy their really expensive EVs.

BRAD SMITH: We've already got some of the delivery and production numbers to our benefit. However, the big question on where that margin, where the profitability is going to maintain itself, and what the outlook for the company looks like, especially as they're netting some new contracts to make sure that they're building out more factories internationally to deliver on the electric vehicle demand right now.

I've got my gold bricks ready, just in case. Just in case.

BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, I don't know what Brat is looking for, besides gold bars. I'm focused on how many times Elon Musk mentions AI, that is artificial intelligence. Brad, I'm saying he's going to mention it 52 times.

BRAD SMITH: I don't know why I have these gold bars here, quite frankly. He's really more focused on Dogecoin anyway. So it's not so much about the digital gold that Bitcoin is, even though Tesla did hold that for quite a while on their balance sheet. Maybe we get an update on if they're inclined to get back into that.

But yes, AI mentions, at least 7, for sure.

BRIAN SOZZI: After the call on Tesla, Yahoo Finance, be there, be square, be electrified.
