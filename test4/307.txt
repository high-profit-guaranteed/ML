The world’s richest man – perhaps unsurprisingly – is not a fan of “woke capitalism”.

“Why ESG is the devil…,” Elon Musk said in a preamble to an article that highlighted tobacco companies perform far higher than Tesla in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) rankings.

Many people will be left scratching their heads over how Tesla, a company whose mission is to consign the internal combustion engine to the history books, can be a less ethical investment than one that sells cigarettes.

Nonetheless, the electric car pioneer scored 37 points out of a possible 100 in an ESG assessment by the data company S&P.

Oil behemoth Chevron scored 43. Philip Morris International, run by chief executive Jacek Olczak and the company behind Marlboro, the world’s favourite cigarette brand, scored 84.

It is just one example of how the ratings, used by pension funds worldwide to decide if companies are ethically compliant, apparently defy common sense.

Tobacco company Altria, for example, has burnished its ESG credentials after going to great lengths to improve the diversity of its board and winning plaudits for its commitment to LGBTQ Equality.

Compare this with Tesla, which fired its LGBT diversity officer last year and whose board is mostly made of white men.

Mindful of the pitfalls, many large investors in Europe are afraid of criticising the current manifestation of the ESG agenda.

Few asset managers would debate the need for ethical and sustainable concerns to form part of the investment process – but most are concerned that it has become “tick box exercise”.

“We have created a bit of a cottage industry when it comes to sustainable investing,” says one source. “The process is not unhelpful. But the results can be very unhelpful.”

The tide is turning in America, where a backlash is gathering momentum.
