Tesla (TSLA) has trimmed prices on its Model S and Model X cars in China. The prices are bing reduced by more than 6%. On Monday, Tesla announced it was cutting the price on its Model Y in the country. Yahoo Finance Live breaks down the stock's reaction.

AKIKO FUJITA: Let's take a look at shares of Tesla trading lower, down about to just over 2.5% after more price cuts in China. The EV maker slashing the prices of its Model S and Model X, each around 7% in China.

This comes against a tough backdrop economically, Seana, when you think about what's been playing out in China. We were talking about this yesterday the latest economic data pointing to continued weakness in the market.

Should note, these price cuts coming back in the market after Tesla, along with 15 other car makers essentially signed a letter saying that they won't be competing under a normal pricing. But this shows you how competitive the market is. And Tesla certainly not alone in pushing for this. Their Chinese rivals have been cutting prices as well.

But, you know, I was thinking back to the comments that we got from RBC's Tom Narayen yesterday, who said there's too much concern around the price cuts because at the end of the day, if you've got higher volume even with the lower margins, that's a positive for the company.

SEANA SMITH: Yeah. And that's at least it seems to be how Elon Musk is looking at it because he's remained at least for now committed to these price cuts, always leaping leaving the door open for more.

We talk about the demand picture, what exactly that looks like obviously, over in China, the slowing-- the very, very slow recovery that we're seeing, all the problems, a disappointing econ data that we've gotten out over the last several weeks certainly painting a tough picture for Tesla and obviously, those domestic players there.

So Tesla needs to do all it can to better compete with those domestic players, how much pressure this is going to place on margins at least in the near term. We see some analysts a little bit more concerned than others. Dan Ives of Wedbush is also one of the analysts that does think it's a smart play in the end and will eventually benefit Tesla. It could put some pressure though, on the stock in near term. And we are seeing the stock off just around 2 and 1/2% today.
