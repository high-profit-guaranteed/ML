Tesla Inc. is returning to the US asset-backed securities market for the first time in over a year, with a $1 billion prime auto-lease transaction, a sign of how credit markets are starting to recover.

The electric-vehicle maker is in the premarketing stage for the deal, according to a person familiar with the matter, who is not authorized to speak publicly and asked not to be identified. It marks Teslaâ€™s first ABS transaction since securing blue-chip status in March.
