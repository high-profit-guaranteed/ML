Television broadcasting company Univision is reportedly claiming copyright on YouTube for Tesla’s video on its second generation Optimus robot.

What Happened: Farzad Mesbahi is a former Tesla Inc TSLA employee and stockholder. On Wednesday, the enthusiast posted a video on YouTube of recent happenings surrounding Tesla including its recent recall of over 2 million vehicles, the recent video of the second generation Optimus and the Cybertruck.

On the day of uploading his video, the YouTuber received a copyright notice from Univision claiming copyright of the Optimus bot video he used in the video, preventing him from monetizing his video.

“Hey @Univision – stop trying to claim copyright on Tesla’s Optimus video, which I used under fair use @YouTube,” Mesbahi wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

On Thursday, Mesbahi took to X again to say that Univision is still claiming copyright of the video on YouTube.

“I’m getting pings from many saying that they’re getting the same copyright notice. Univision is claiming the content as its own and is escrowing all earnings,” Mesbahi alleged.

What’s In The Video: Tesla revealed its upgraded humanoid robot- the Gen 2 Optimus- in a video on X earlier this week. The highlight of the new bot were its hands which CEO Elon Musk deems can thread a needle in a year.

The Gen 2 Optimus can walk 30% faster, is 22 lbs (10 Kg) lighter, and has improved body control including hands. This enables the bot to handle delicate objects such as eggs with the added help of tactile sensing on its fingers.

"So much engineering has gone into the hands. In a year, it will be able to thread a needle," Musk said later in a post.
