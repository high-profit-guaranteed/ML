We are marching into the 19th week of Benzinga's series, "Is ChatGPT A Better Financial Advisor?" With only seven weeks left in this six-month experiment, every basis point matters as ChatGPT seeks to climb the ranks and narrow the gap with the top portfolios.

The competition kicked off when Benzinga gave ChatGPT a hypothetical $10,000, challenging it to create an investment portfolio that could rival the giants of Wall Street. So, as we inch closer to the conclusion of our experiment, where does the AI stand?

Recovering from last week's slip, ChatGPT's portfolio surged to seventh place.

Now, with the countdown ticking and seven weeks left, ChatGPT's portfolio is taking aim at major players like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY and the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 QQQ.

On the losing side, Nike Inc NKE still grapples with challenges, sitting at a 17.68% loss.

As per the experiment's rules, the ChatGPT portfolio will maintain its positions until the conclusion, holding firm with diamond hands.

Where does this week leave us? It's clear that ChatGPT's portfolio is staging a comeback, looking to finish strong in the final stretch of this experiment.
