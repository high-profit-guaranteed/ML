Good Morning Traders! In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.

Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.

We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis:

The SPY SPY is currently trading around our focal point of 507.52. For those looking on the optimistic side, we're aiming for an initial climb to 508.34. Should the market maintain its momentum above this mark, we anticipate a move towards our intermediate target at 509.49. Holding above 509.49 during the trading session could signal a further ascent to 510.14, with our ultimate bullish objective for the day being 510.95.

Conversely, if the SPY struggles to maintain 507.52 as a base, we foresee a downward test to 506.71. Presence of sellers at this juncture could drive the price further down to 506.06. Breaching this level under significant selling pressure might bring into play a more substantial floor at 505.32, with the most pessimistic scenario for the day setting our bearish benchmark at 503.95.

The QQQ QQQ, also known as the Q's, is hovering around a crucial juncture at 437.47. Bullish participants are encouraged by stability above this level, eyeing 438.89 as the next milestone. A firm establishment of support here could pave the way to 440.00, with a strong market potentially testing 440.78. The highest ambition for bulls today is to reach 440.78.

If the Q's falter below 437.47, we anticipate bearish momentum to push the price towards 436.58. Any signs of frailty here might lead to a further dip to 435.88. Persistent selling could challenge the resilience at 434.76, with a breakdown here setting the stage for our deepest bearish target at 433.64.

Apple AAPL is trading near our specified level of 183.38. Bullish scenarios hinge on maintaining this as a supportive base, with ambitions to elevate the price to 184.09. A sustained bullish drive could extend to 184.59, with the day's bullish climax potentially reaching 185.86.

Should Apple's support at 183.38 give way, we anticipate a descent to 182.96. Continued bearish pressure could see the price sliding to 182.27, with a significant sell-off possibly breaching the 181.25 threshold. The ultimate bearish target for the day is set at 180.60.

Microsoft MSFT is positioned around our benchmark of 413.14. Optimists are looking for the price to stay buoyant above this level, aiming for a rally to 414.56. A secure position here could signal a bullish trend towards 416.32, with the day's peak bull goal at 417.25.

On the flip side, if Microsoft cannot sustain support at 413.14, we expect a bearish exploration towards 411.72. Breaking through this floor could lead to further declines to 410.64, with sustained bearish momentum potentially driving the price to 409.69. The lowest bearish expectation for the day is at 408.46.

NVIDIA NVDA is navigating around the pivotal point of 799.10. Bulls are eyeing an upward movement to 804.61, hoping to secure this level as a firm foundation. Success here could spur a rally to 810.13, with continued bullish sentiment possibly reaching 816.95. The top bullish target for NVIDIA today is set at 827.98.

If NVIDIA fails to hold 799.10 as a support, we're braced for a dip to 794.94. A breach of this level, underlined by seller dominance, could lead to a fall to 791.44. A weaker market might necessitate a reevaluation at 787.68, with the most bearish outlook for the day pegging the target at 785.35.

Alphabet GOOGL finds itself around the mark of 143.17. Bullish forces are rallying for a push beyond this level to 144.72. Maintaining momentum could lead to a test of 145.94, marking the highest bullish aspiration for the day.

Conversely, if Alphabet cannot secure 143.17 as a foundation, the path opens for a downward move to 142.53. Failing to hold this level could see a further decline to 141.71, with a pronounced sell-off potentially pushing the price to the day's most bearish target at 141.12.

Meta META is currently positioned at 485.96. Bulls are aiming to uphold this level as a baseline, with sights set on an advance to 488.81. A robust buying wave could elevate the price to 492.33, with the ultimate bullish target for the day being 495.54.

Should Meta's support at 485.96 erode, we anticipate a descent to 483.11. Persistent bearish activity could extend the downturn to 480.96, with a significant breach here possibly leading to our most bearish endpoint of the day at 479.47.

Tesla TSLA is trading near the critical level of 195.91. Bullish scenarios revolve around pushing the price to 197.50, with further buying potentially leading to 200.43. A strong bullish market could challenge 204.33, with the day's highest bullish target being 206.71.

If Tesla cannot maintain 195.91 as a supportive threshold, we're prepared for a test to 193.81. Increased selling could bring 191.52 into focus, with a break below this level setting the bearish objective for the day at 189.22.

Final Word: Today's trading session lacks significant US economic data. Market movements as we conclude this shorter trading week will likely be influenced by the expiration of weekly option flows. Key stocks to monitor for institutional positioning include NVIDIA and Meta. Wishing everyone a successful and fruitful Friday.
