Recent controversial posts by Tesla Inc TSLA CEO Elon Musk have sparked strong reactions from Tesla owners, leading some to reconsider their future purchasing decisions.

What Happened: Musk recently stirred controversy for endorsing an antisemitic conspiracy theory, drawing swift responses from advertisers, investors and Tesla drivers alike.

A New York City-based Tesla owner voiced disagreement with Musk’s criticism of the Anti-Defamation League and his endorsement of an antisemitic tweet in a report by the Business Insider. “I try to stay in my lane. This is my wife’s car, but I’d think twice about buying another Tesla,” they said.

In Monterey, California, another Tesla driver expressed concern that Musk’s actions were damaging the brand’s reputation. “I just want to drive my car. I don’t want anyone to hate me because I’m driving a Tesla,” he said, as per the report.

Meanwhile, a woman at the Brooklyn Museum reportedly indicated she wouldn’t renew her lease or purchase a Tesla due to Musk’s behavior. Conversely, another Tesla owner at the same location, unaware of the controversy, said that they remain loyal to the EV brand.

Many other drivers shared similar sentiments as per the report, indicating that Musk’s behavior could potentially impact their decision to purchase a Tesla in the future.

Why It Matters: Ross Gerber, president and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management and a Tesla investor, also announced his intention to replace his Model Y with a Rivian vehicle next year. In a post on X, Gerber wrote, "Sadly, this is a win for Rivian … I will be replacing my Tesla model Y for a Rivian next year and I'm sure the rest of LA will as well."

The recent backlash comes on the heels of Musk backing a post on X that Jewish communities are pushing hatred against whites.

"You have said the actual truth," Musk wrote on X. He was responding to a post that promoted the "great replacement” conspiracy theory, a widely debunked theory that holds that non-white people are calculatedly replacing the white population via migration and ultimately leading to a “white genocide.”

Musk on Wednesday also alleged that the Anti -Defamation League, a Jewish advocacy group and NGO, “unjustly attacks the majority of the west.”
