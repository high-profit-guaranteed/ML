Tesla, Inc. TSLA’s Cybertruck launch event is exactly a week away. CEO Elon Musk amped up expectations by providing an update Wednesday on the logistics of the much-awaited electric pickup truck, and an analyst who is uber-bullish on the vehicle offered his take on the potential pricing.

Cybertruck Heads To Tesla Stores: “Cybertrucks are on their way to Tesla stores in North America!” said Musk said in a post on his social media platform X. His comments came as he shared a story from the website Tesla Oracle that said Cybertrucks are being delivered to more stores ahead of Black Friday.

Another Tesla enthusiast shared a video of a Cybertruck that he spotted in the Santana Row district of San Jose, California.

Cybertruck Price Shrouded In Mystery: With Tesla yet to give a hint regarding the vehicle, rumors abound about how much Cybertruck will cost a customer. The Future Fund‘s Gary Black said in a post on Wednesday that he has been unsuccessful in getting the pricing from his contacts in Chicago.

Musk “wouldn't create a huge Cybertruck delivery event in Austin only to disappoint the crowd on price,” the fund manager said, adding: “affordability is important.”

His price expectations for various trim levels are as follows:

Black said he expects the dual and tri-motor versions to be available initially. All trims will qualify for the $7,500 EV credit that goes off-invoice starting Jan. 1, he added.

In a separate post, the fund manager said that when Cybertruck launches Nov. 30, it will be the “biggest people magnet vehicle we've ever seen,” he said.

“It will spark a huge halo effect of interest in the entire Tesla franchise unlike any vehicle seen over the years.”

Tesla ended Wednesday’s session down 2.9% at $234.21, according to Benzinga Pro data.
