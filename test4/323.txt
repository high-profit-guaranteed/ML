In the coming weeks, electric vehicle owners will be able to recharge their ride in Chandler.

Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) is currently building a 12-stall supercharger at the Park at San Tan mixed-use development off Ray Road and Loop 101. Located at 3075 W. Ray Road, this will be the first Tesla supercharger within the city of Chandler with the next closest charging station at Arizona Mills shopping center more than nine miles away.

Park at San Tan is owned by Denver-based DPC Companies. Tony Kill, vice president of development for DPC, said the push to bring Tesla into the mix at Park at San Tan came from existing tenants.

"We're seeing more and more office tenants in the marketplace request an on-site charging facility as a landlord-provided item," he said. "In the leasing market, it's becoming a requirement. They used to want a fitness facility on-site or proximity to food and beverage. Now it's 'do you have charging stations on-site?'"

Located in Chandler's Price Corridor, Park at San Tan is home to a 217,345-square-foot office building and another nearly 20,000-square-foot retail center. DPC bought the Park at San Tan office complex in Chandler for $65 million from TA Realty in December 2020.

Tesla is working with Salt River Project to power the supercharging site, which Kill expects to be up and running sometime in July. The construction started at the beginning of May, Kill said.

Those chargers will also be accessible by Rivian Automotive's electric trucks early next year. Earlier this week, the California-based EV company announced it was giving its customers access to Tesla's charging network across the United States and Canada as early as next spring. The deal follows similar deals that automotive giants Ford and General Motors have made recently with Tesla.

Last September, the Biden administration unveiled plans to spend $5 billion over the course of five years to boost the nation’s electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Arizona will be among the first states to receive the funding, which amounts to more than $76 million over the next five years to build-out EV charging in the state, including upgrading existing stations and establishing new stations.

The funding comes from the Department of Transportation’s new National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program, established and funded as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

An effort behind the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is to bring more than 500,000 EV chargers across the United States by 2030, which would quadruple the number of chargers as of December.

The Phoenix metro has positioned itself as a growing hub for the production of EVs and other alt-fuel vehicles, with the Lucid Motors Inc. factory in Casa Grande and the Nikola Corp. manufacturing facility in Coolidge, along with Nikola's plans to build a hydrogen fuel production hub in Buckeye. Multiple other companies in this space have also set up shop in the Valley.
