In the latest ranking of the most American-made cars by Cars.com, Tesla, Inc. TSLA emerged as the clear winner, maintaining its top position for the third consecutive year. All of Tesla’s electric vehicles secured the top four spots, demonstrating their strong domestic manufacturing presence.

Rankings Decoded: The comprehensive survey evaluated 388 vehicles and selected 100 to be included in the list. These cars were assessed based on five key criteria, including assembly location, parts content, engine origin, transmission origin, and the U.S. manufacturing workforce.

Tesla’s Model Y SUV claimed the top spot, followed closely by the Model 3 in the sedan category. The Model X and Model S secured the third and fourth positions, respectively, in the SUV and sedan categories.

Others That Made The Cut: Honda Motor Company Ltd HMC also had a significant presence in the rankings, with its Passport SUV, Odyssey minivan, Ridgeline pickup truck, and Accord sedan occupying the fifth, seventh, ninth, and 11th spots, respectively.

Acura, Honda’s luxury and performance division, saw its MDX SUV, RDX SUV, and Acura hatchback ranked eighth, tenth, and thirteenth, respectively.

Volkswagen AG‘s VWAGY ID.4 electric SUV was the only non-Tesla and non-Honda vehicle to break into the top 10.

Among the U.S. automakers, the highest ranking was for Ford Motor Co.'s F Lincoln Corsair SUV, which was ranked 16th. General Motors Corp GM Chevrolet Corvette was in the 19th spot.

EVs Gaining Charge: Notably, the rankings highlighted a growing shift towards electrification, with the number of hybrid and all-electric models increasing from 14 to 22 compared to the previous year.

Notable Omissions: However, Cars.com mentioned that Rivian Automotive, Inc.'s RIVN EVs and the GMC Hummer EV SUV were excluded from the rankings due to their gross vehicle weight ratings exceeding the maximum limit set by the American Automobile Labeling Act. The forthcoming Hummer EV SUV, Chevrolet Silverado EV, Ram 1500 REV, and Tesla’s Cybertruck would also face constraints based on this criterion.

These results come as positive news for Tesla, aligning with the Biden administration’s push to strengthen domestic industries by promoting localized production.
