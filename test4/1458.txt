Wall Street’s outlook on Tesla Inc. is darkening rapidly, with at least two analysts turning more cautious on the electric vehicle maker in as many days.

Some of the EVs made by Tesla may no longer qualify for government subsidies in the US and in some European countries in 2024, putting further pressure on the company’s revenue at a time when demand for these car are already slated to slow, the analysts said.
