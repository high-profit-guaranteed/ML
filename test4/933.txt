In a recent podcast appearance, Joe Rogan and UFC champion Sean O’Malley discussed the exceptional speed of Tesla Inc.’s TSLA Model X Plaid, leading Elon Musk to reiterate once again that he "stole" the product roadmap from "Spaceballs."

What Happened: On Friday, an X (formerly Twitter) user shared a podcast snippet on the platform. During the podcast, Rogan, a well-known Tesla enthusiast, didn’t seem to be able to contain his excitement about the Model X Plaid’s performance.

“I’m faster in my Plaid than my Porsche, and it makes no sound… It time travels. 0 to 60 in 1.9 seconds for a four-door sedan. It’s bonkers," he said.

O’Malley chimed in with his own experiences, having received speeding tickets while driving the Model X Plaid. “I got pulled over again in literally the exact same highway, same neighborhood, same cop. Those Xs are insane. Even on the highway, you’re going 90, it feels like you are going 60…”

Rogan also shared a unique parenting experience, revealing, “I taught my 15-year-old how to drive in that. It’s always on Ludicrous Mode. It’s easy to control. That’s the difference between that and other high-powered cars."

Musk, never one to miss an opportunity for humor, commented on the post about the podcast with a quip, “The only thing beyond ludicrous is plaid.”

He later commented, “I stole the Tesla product roadmap from Spaceballs,” in reference to the classic Mel Brooks spoof on the Star Wars franchise.

Why It's Important: This isn’t the first time Musk has referenced “Spaceballs” in relation to Tesla’s products. In 2021, the tech billionaire, while addressing people outside Tesla’s facility in Fremont, California, said that the Model S Plaid serves as evidence that electric cars can be environmentally friendly, speedy, and secure.
