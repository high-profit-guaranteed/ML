Tesla Inc.’s electric vehicles took the top four spots on this year’s Cars.com Inc. list of the most-American-made cars, the second time in as many years all of the EV-maker’s models ranked in the top ten.

Tesla’s Model Y SUV, Model 3 sedan, Model X SUV and Model S sedan ranked in spots one through four, according to a ranking released Wednesday by the online vehicle listing and data provider. Volkswagen AG’s ID.4 SUV was the only other EV to crack the top ten, which was otherwise dominated by Honda Motor Co.’s namesake and premium Acura brand models.
