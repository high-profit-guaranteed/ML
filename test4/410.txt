The announcement has sent shockwaves through social media, as it appears that MrBeast has taken a playful jab at none other than Tesla CEO Musk himself.

It is pertinent to note that MrBeast is no stranger to lavish giveaways and has built a reputation for bestowing extravagant prizes upon lucky recipients.

For example, in January this year, Donaldson helped 1,000 people get cataract surgeries and thousands of dollars in cash. He also gave one teen surgery recipient a brand new Tesla Model 3.

Why It's Important: Making history once again, MrBeast achieved a remarkable feat by becoming the inaugural user to amass a staggering one million followers on Threads, according to the official Guinness World Records listing.

Currently, Donaldson boasts an impressive 3.4 million followers on the platform, a figure that pales in comparison to his Twitter following of 21.6 million.

For the unversed, Meta's Threads has now become the fastest app to cross the one million users mark, surpassing OpenAI's AI-powered chatbot, chatGPT’s record. According to a Threads post shared by Zuckerberg on Thursday, Meta witnessed 30 million sign-ups on its inaugural day.
