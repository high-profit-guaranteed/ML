Tesla Inc. (TSLA) is conducting a recall of 1.6 million vehicles in China with the aim of rectifying issues emanating from its Autopilot driver assistance system and mitigating the potential for collisions. This comes on the heels of two similar recalls actioned by Tesla in the United States last month. The automaker embarked on a mass-scale recall, exceeding 2 million vehicles, to insert new protective measures into its Autopilot advanced driver-assistance system in accordance with safety concerns raised by federal regulators.

TSLA’s most recent quarter saw Tesla’s market control drop to 50%, a significant decrease from the 62% grip it held during the first quarter. In spite of instigating a price battle to bolster its position amidst fierce competition within the electric vehicle segment, several other auto manufacturers have resorted to drastic price reductions to fight against the challenging demand landscape brought on by rampant inflation and escalating lending costs.

In November 2023, HSBC Global initiated coverage with a “reduce” rating and a $146 price target. On the bearish side, HSBC analysts wrote, “Significant delays or developments that show lack of technological and/or regulatory feasibility for a commercial launch of these projects pose a significant risk for Tesla.”

Furthermore, TSLA finds itself under mounting pressure due to an expanding worker strike in Sweden coupled with labor stress in the United States.

In addition, considering its elevated valuation, alternative players within the industry may prove to be more prudent investments when anticipating the technology surge in 2024. Analyzing some of its key performance indicators could offer meaningful insights.

Examining Tesla Inc’s Financial Trends from 2021 to 2023

In analyzing the trailing-12-month net income of TSLA, there is a clear trend of an overall increase, albeit with slight fluctuations, from March 2021 to September 2023 based on the provided data. Noteworthy changes are as follows:
• From March 2021 to December 2022, TSLA’s Net Income consistently grew from $1.14 billion to $12.56 billion.
• The Net Income experienced a small drop in the first quarter of 2023 to $11.75 billion but again picked up in June 2023 reaching a peak at $12.19 billion.
• As of the final entry in the series, September 2023, there is a noticeable dip in the Net Income to $10.76 billion.

The growth rate, measuring the first value against the last value in the series, indicates an overall substantial increase, demonstrating an approximately 842% rise ($1.14 billion to $10.76 billion). Despite minor fluctuations, this data represents a dramatic upward trend in Tesla’s Net Income over the span of two and a half years. This trend, particularly the most recent decrease in Net Income, should be a crucial focal point moving forward. Further data and analysis would be needed to predict whether this represents a temporary setback or a shift in Tesla Inc.’s financial health.

The Gross Margin trend of TSLA over the observed period shows a general growth with some fluctuations.
• Starting at 21.2% by the end of the first quarter, 2021, Gross Margin increased relatively steady reaching a peak at the end of second quarter, 2022, where it stood at 27.1%.
• From that point, the data shows a gradual downward trend, with third quarter, 2022 and fourth quarter, 2022 reporting 26.6% and 25.6% respectively.
• The trend further declines into 2023 where Gross Margin decreases to 23.1% in the first quarter, 21.5% in second, and then to 19.8% by the end of third quarter.

Overall, the reported Gross Margin shows a growth rate of -2.4% from the first quarter, 2021 to third quarter, 2023. Despite the fluctuations, it’s important to note the considerable growth witnessed up until mid 2022 before the downward trend.

• Reaching a peak of 16.5% in the third quarter of 2022, it closed the year at 17.2% on December 31.

However, the following year saw a reverse in this growing trend:
• By March 31, 2023, the ROA reduced to 15.1%.
• A further fall was reported in the second quarter, with the ROA down to 14.6% as of June 30, 2023.

In summary, the ROA of Tesla Inc. showed an ascending trend from March 2021 to December 2022, climbing from 2.4% to a peak of 17.2%, suggesting an increase of approximately 617%. However, the trend reversed in 2023 with a consistent drop in the ROA down to 12.2% as of the end of September 2023. This current stance represents an approximately 408% growth from the initial value in March 2021.

The overall trend demonstrates constant fluctuations. However, the value never dipped below the starting point of 0.76. Unsurprisingly, these fluctuations reveal the dynamic nature of the company’s efficiency in using its assets to generate sales.

An evident peak in the growth rate is noticeable around mid-September 2023, whereas a principal dip occurred at the beginning of November 2023.
