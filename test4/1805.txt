U.S. GDP numbers are due this morning, with fourth-quarter growth forecast to have slowed significantly as high interest rates led consumers to hold back spending even as the economy escaped a recession. Tesla (TSLA) shares are down after reporting disappointing fourth-quarter results, Comcast (CMCSA) shares are rising after beating earnings expectations and Boeing (BA) faces a new setback. Here's what investors need to know today.

The U.S. economy is forecast to have slowed sharply in the fourth quarter last year, as high interest rates dragged down consumer spending. The output of the economy as measured by gross domestic product is expected to have grown at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 2% in the fourth quarter, less than half the 4.9% pace of the third quarter and the slowest in more than a year. The numbers will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET.



Tesla Inc.'s (TSLA) shares were 8% lower in pre-market trading, after the electric vehicle (EV) maker posted fourth-quarter earnings that fell short of analysts' expectations and warned of weaker growth ahead. The company, which has been overtaken by China's BYD as the world's top EV seller, said in its investor update that its 2024 vehicle volume growth may be “notably lower” than last year’s.

Intel (INTC) will report after the closing bell, with investors focused on sales of the company’s recently launched processors, as well as insights on how it is capitalizing on the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Analysts project that Intel’s revenue will rise to $15.17 billion for the latest quarter, while net income will be nearly $1 billion, sharply up from the $661 million loss the year before. The stock is up 1.5% in pre-market trading.



Boeing (BA) shares were down about 2.5% in pre-market trading after the Federal Aviation Administration blocked the company from expanding production of its 737 Max 9 jets, although the models have been cleared for flying after inspections are completed. The U.S. aviation regulator grounded 171 Boeing planes after an Alaska Airlines (ALK) Max 9 lost a panel mid-flight, forcing an emergency landing.



Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) shares rose 2.5% in pre-market trading after the company reported higher-than-forecast fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 results this morning. The company reported net income of 81 cents a share versus 70 cents a year earlier, against analysts' expectations of flat growth. Revenue was $31.25 billion, above the $30.4 billion expected by analysts. Comcast also said the company added a net 3 million subscribers to its Peacock streaming service in the 4th quarter.
