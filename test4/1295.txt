Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) filed a lawsuit against the Swedish Transport Agency on Monday after postal employees in the country began blocking deliveries of license plates for its electric vehicles (EVs).

The postal employees halted deliveries in solidarity with striking workers and unions, who have organized large-scale industrial action against the Elon Musk-led electric car maker.

Last month, more than 130 mechanics went on strike over Tesla’s refusal to agree to a collective bargaining agreement with the workers in its service division, which includes technicians and mechanics.

Tesla’s suit argues that the Swedish government has a “constitutional obligation to provide registration plates to vehicle owners” and that the company should be able to collect the license plates directly rather than receive them by mail.

Tesla delivered 9,167 vehicles to Sweden in 2022, according to the filing, and the Model Y is the company’s best-selling car in the country thus far in 2023.

In addition to the Swedish Transport Agency, Tesla also sued the country’s post office, according to reports.

“This seizure of license plates constitutes a discriminatory attack without any support in law directed at Tesla. This measure cannot be described in any other way than as a unique attack on a company operating in Sweden,” Tesla said in the filing, according to a translation produced by CNBC.

Musk, for his part, added “This is insane,” in response to a post about the license plate delays on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter, which he also owns.
