His bold call arrives a day after the EV giant came in well below Street estimates for deliveries in the first quarter (read more). On CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe”, Lekander said this morning:

Per Lekander has been short $TSLA since 2020.

The Nasdaq-listed firm which was reported moving forward with plans of setting up a plant in India today has not so far responded to his remarks on Wednesday.

Per Lekander expects Tesla Inc to earn $1.40 on a per-share basis this year.

He sees the $527 billion company based out of Austin, Texas as a “no growth” story and, therefore, finds its fair to be valued at 10 times forward earnings. $TSLA, in comparison, has a forward multiple of 58 times at writing.

The electric vehicles behemoth is scheduled to report its full financial report for the first quarter on April 17th.

Note that Lekander’s view is in stark contrast with Cathie Wood of Ark Invest who loaded up on shares of Tesla again on the weakness this morning saying it “epitomizes the convergence among technologies we see today”.
