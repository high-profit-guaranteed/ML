Tesla Inc TSLA CEO Elon Musk is once again under scrutiny as he faces a proposed $258 million class action lawsuit accusing him of insider trading and manipulating the meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin DOGE/USD.

Allegations: Investors allege that Musk used various tactics, including Twitter posts, paid influencers, and his appearance on “Saturday Night Live,” to profit from Dogecoin at their expense, using wallets controlled by him or Tesla. The news was reported earlier by Reuters and Gizmodo.

The Twitter Logo Swap: A key incident mentioned in the lawsuit is Musk’s sale of around $124 million worth of Dogecoin in April, shortly after replacing Twitter’s logo with Dogecoin’s Shiba Inu dog logo. This move resulted in a significant 30% price surge for Dogecoin. Investors claim that Musk deliberately manipulated the market and engaged in insider trading, defrauding them while promoting himself and his companies.

Counterpoints: Musk’s lawyer and Tesla have chosen not to comment on the allegations, and the investors’ lawyer has yet to respond. This lawsuit has been ongoing since June of last year, with the investors incorporating these new accusations in a proposed third amended complaint. In April, Musk’s lawyers filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, calling the previous claims a “fanciful work of fiction” based on his innocuous tweets.

Red Flags Of DOGE Past: Financial analyst Ric Edelman expressed strong opposition to Dogecoin two years ago, referring to it as the “bad boy of crypto.” He said the crypto has a lack of legitimate use cases and said wealthy individuals, including Musk, were involved in a pump-and-dump scheme that caused extreme price volatility.

Edelman also faulted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for not providing sufficient oversight, creating an environment prone to risky behavior and quick wealth accumulation in the cryptocurrency space.

Price Action: Dogecoin was trading up 0.5% at $0.07214 over the past 24 hours at the time of writing, according to data from Benzinga Pro.
