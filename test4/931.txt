Tesla (TSLA) is trimming the costs of its Model 3 and Model Y EVs. Most versions of the Model 3 are getting a price cut of $1,250, while the long-range version of the Model Y SUV is now $2,000 cheaper. It comes after the EV maker reported third quarter deliveries that missed expectations. Yahoo Finance Live discuss the latest price cuts.

BRAD SMITH: Let's also talk about shares of Tesla this morning. They are on the move in extended hours as the car manufacturer sees shares decline by about 2.4%. They are changing their prices for [? checks ?] [? notes ?] the sixth time this year.

This time they are slashing prices for its Model 3 and Model Y this morning. Earlier this week, the company missed market estimates for its third quarter deliveries after upgrades to its factories forced production to come to a standstill. There you're taking a look at shares as we mentioned here, but again, we talked about the price wars earlier this week, especially when we were getting some of the production, the delivery numbers pretty much around the globe from EV manufacturers and nonEV manufacturers, but what automobile company isn't talking about EV manufacturing at this point in time?

But all this considered, Tesla trying to make sure that it not only retains the market share that it's been able to amass in the EV landscape-- EVs still represent less than 10% of the [? autopurchasing. ?]

So even as you see mandates start to be put in place in certain regions around the world, China most notably one of those entities or one of those nations that has instituted this and that increases year-over-year, Tesla is not only trying to get people into their ecosystem but trying to maintain them there, and that's where these price cuts make even more of a difference in just trying to get people into it so that you can eventually get into a relationship with that customer of a trade-in, trade-up perhaps long term.

SEANA SMITH: Yeah, and I think Tesla is evident in the delivery numbers that they reported earlier this week. They potentially needed to price cuts even further in order to boost demand. They had already cut prices by about 15% to 20% on some models, but they still fell significantly short of the earlier in the year volume expectations that we had-- that we heard laid out here from Tesla.

In terms of the pressure that this could put on margins, obviously, a huge issue on the street. JP Morgan out with a note earlier this week ahead of these price cuts that we're just getting today saying that the large declines in average selling price has exacerbated the impact that we're seeing on the volume shortfall on all other performance metrics.

So certainly a focal point of the street when we talk about the margins under pressure. Now, many analysts have said that a short-term pain for long-term gain. And as long as they continue to somehow hold the market share that they do have in the EV business, are able to hold off some of the competitors out there.

You mentioned the fact that almost every auto giant is talking about EVs, and you're right. They're all trying to figure out how they can push further into the EV business when some of that market share there from Tesla who is by far the leader in this space. So Tesla doing all it can in order to preserve some of that market share, being forced to discount models even more. We'll see whether or not it moves the needle in terms of demand.

BRAD SMITH: Yeah, and just coming full circle on the pricing here, I mean, you look at the 3 and the Y here, that is a car that is essentially for the Y. 75% of the Model Y is the Model 3. So production efficiency is there. It's just a matter of, OK, where are consumers opting into not just the base but also adding on some of these extra packages too. And I think that that's where Tesla is looking perhaps for some of the odd charges.

SEANA SMITH: If we can make sure that the base cost is lower, then how can we make sure that we're correctly marketing some of the higher performance packages, some of the longer ranges as well. And that's exactly where I think going to perhaps carve out their own strategy not just in communication but in marketing in some of the events that they've made. Yeah, Tesla needs to deliver 475,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter in order to hit their end of year target.
