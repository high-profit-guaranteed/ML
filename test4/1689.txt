): The recent launch of the long-awaited cyber truck has initiated strong revenue growth as customers flock to buy it.

): Strong financials and the low-price high-quality strategy are key factors for why this company is poised for trillion-dollar status.

The U.S. economy is poised for a positive 2024, with steady growth, a strong job market and optimistic stock projections.

The positive future of the U.S. economy seems promising, according to Jeremy Siegel, emeritus professor of finance at the Wharton School. He believes the economy has achieved a “Goldilocks pace” of growth, with recent data showing a robust job market and steady unemployment rates. Despite concerns about potential inflation from rising wages and geopolitical tensions impacting oil prices, Siegel sees the overall economic landscape as favorable. With this positive outlook, the market will perform well, and now is the time to invest in these three trillion-dollar stocks.

Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: ) is an American warehouse company that retails quality items for a low price. It is a membership warehouse, meaning a customer must buy and hold a Costco membership yearly.

COST’s stock is currently valued at $673.58. It’s worth noting the year is still young, so this isn’t indicative of much. In addition, analysts have projected a 12-month price forecast of $675 and $755.

Costco’s market cap went up from $202.61 billion in 2022 to $292.89 in 2023, representing a growth of 44.56%. COST’s Levered FCF Growth (YoY) reached 261.89% by the end of 2023, nearly 830.92% larger than the sector median of 28.13%. These metrics indicate that Costco is growing steadily while remaining extremely profitable.

COST’s main competitive advantage lies in its membership system, which gives card owners an incentive to continue shopping at Costco. In addition, the company’s bulk sale strategy draws customers shopping for large families. Costco often cuts ties with brands not willing to lower prices in favor of its own brand, Kirkland. That ensures prices are always relatively low. Almost no major retail business has been able to replicate Costco’s model, allowing it to continue dominating the market.

The company’s unique deals and marketing strategies have led to major success, evidenced by its financials. If this growth continues, it could reach a trillion-dollar status in the coming year.

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) is an American electric car and storage manufacturer that creates products like solar panels, stationary battery storage and cars. TSLA has amassed a valuation of $227.22 with a strong year-over-year valuation increase of 83.89%.

TSLA’s is fully established in the market but shows signs of future growth. Valued at $691.81 billion in 2023, the electric vehicle (EV) market size was estimated at $438.19 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $1091.1 billion in 2030 at a CAGR of 13.92%.

Overall, annual financial results proved to be successful for TSLA, with the company outperforming previous years on EBITDA by 84.85%.

TSLA is set up for success through recent announcements of its new vehicles. Tesla recently started shipping the Cybertruck, a long-awaited electric, modern pickup truck. Currently, Tesla’s U.S. market share even tops Volkswagen (OTCMKTS: ), Subaru and BMW (OTCMKTS: ). As TSLA continues to include an emphasis on creating quality products, expect TSLA’s valuation to climb as more customers gravitate towards the company’s products and services.

TSM is set up for success through its technological advancements. Sources report that TSMC’s main competitor is Samsung. But even that company is far behind in advanced chips and doesn’t have the same capacity as TSMC. Moreover, even though Intel (NASDAQ: ) has the advantage of government support, it still can not compete with the experience and expertise of TSMC. As Taiwan Semiconductor continues to emphasize quality products, expect its valuation to climb as more customers gravitate towards its services.
