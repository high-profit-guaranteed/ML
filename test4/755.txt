Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. is partnering with Tesla Inc. to install 20,000 universal electrical vehicle chargers at 2,000 of its hotels in the US, Canada and Mexico.

The McLean, Virginia-based company said it plans to have at least six wall-mounted chargers at selected hotels that will work with any electric vehicle model, beginning in 2024. The move would make Hilton’s EV charging network the largest of any hospitality company, the hotel group said. It would also expand Tesla’s dominance in EV charging.
