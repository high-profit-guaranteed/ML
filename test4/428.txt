The EV market remains on investors’ radar amid continuous innovation and rising demand all over the world.

Despite the fact that over the past few years major companies have entered the EV industry in a bid to shift from traditional cars to EVs, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) remains the market leader. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares have gained about 136% in 2023 through June 29. The stock recently jumped after the company entered into a new partnership with General Motors which would see GM EVs using Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s charging network.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s Supercharger network has about 17,700 fast chargers in the U.S and the company’s charging network is considered the most reliable in the country. GM isn’t the only company that signed a charging partnership with Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).

The EV industry will only grow from here amid the US government’s resolve to hasten the shift to EVs from traditional cars to cut the nation’s reliance on fossil fuels and decrease pollution. In April 2023 The Environmental Protection Agency proposed new, tougher standards that will force car companies to speed up their transition to EVs. The US is also planning to spend a whopping $7.5 billion to expand the EV charging network as part of the $1 trillion infrastructure bill passed in 2021. The latest proposals and rules would mean that “two out of every three personal vehicles sold by 2032 would be an EV,” according to a report by the WSJ.
