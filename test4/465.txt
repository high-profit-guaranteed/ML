Jim Cramer, the renowned host of CNBC’s Mad Money, is widely recognized as a successful stock market investor. However, his track record hasn’t been without its fair share of criticism. Despite his accomplishments, Cramer has faced relentless mockery on social media due to his numerous poor stock predictions over the years.

In that context, fans of the world’s largest electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) expressed their joy on social media after Cramer tweeted on July 17 that he feels more confident about Ford’s (NYSE: F) F-150 Lightning truck than Tesla’s Cybertruck.

Cramer’s remarks come after Ford announced substantial price cuts for its F-150 pickups of as much as $10,000. Meanwhile, Tesla completed the construction of its first Cybertruck on July 15 in its Texas gigafactory.

Interestingly, the pattern continued as TSLA shares opened higher at Monday market open, while Ford’s stock sank.

The post attracted a string of sarcastic comments, implying that Tesla followers should be happy about Cramer’s pro-Ford comments.

Although anti-Cramer views expressed by retail investors may sometimes be exaggerated, it is difficult to overlook the numerous instances where the 68-year-old television personality has been proven wrong in his predictions.

For instance, in September 2022, Cramer said he was short on Nvidia’s shares (NASDAQ: NVDA), calling the stock “a loser.” This year, NVDA is one of the best-performing stocks in the market, with a year-to-date surge of nearly 220%.

Similarly, in January 2023, Cramer urged investors to “move out” of Bitcoin (BTC) when the leading cryptocurrency stood at around $17,000. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $30,263, up about 80% since Cramer’s tweet.
