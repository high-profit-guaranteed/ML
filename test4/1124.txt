Good Morning Traders! In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, TSLA, and NVDA.

Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members during our daily Morning Call, prior to the opening of the market.

We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis:

The SPY SPY is currently being traded around our level of 416.54. For those bullish, an initial upward movement to 417.47 is desirable. If strong price action persists above 417.47, we expect buyers to elevate the price to our support mark of 418.17. Should 418.17 withstand during regular trading hours, a further upward shove to 419.04 is anticipated. The high target for bullish outlook on SPY today is 420.05.

Should 416.54 fail to maintain support, we foresee a challenge from the bears at 415.71. If sellers emerge, a further test lower at 415.08 and 414.46 is expected. A breach of this level on substantial selling reveals a robust support lower at 413.59. A turbulent sell-off today could take the bearish target lower to 412.59.

The Q's QQQ are now being traded around our pivotal level of 349.28. For the bullish, holding above 349.28 is key. Should this level sustain as support, 350.07 is eyed as strong support. Sustained buying could bring 351.00 into contention. The high bullish target for the Q's today stands at 352.55.

A struggle to remain above 349.28 during today’s regular trading hours could see bears seizing control, driving prices down to 347.95. In case of a weakness, a further downward test at 346.80 is likely. If support at this level crumbles, a bearish descent to the day’s low target of 345.64 is projected.

Apple AAPL is currently being traded around our level of 169.95. For the bullish, holding 169.02 as support is crucial. A bullish rally to 171.03 is hoped for, with sustained momentum possibly driving prices to 171.66. If bullish forces reign today, an upward push to the day's high target of 172.35 for Apple is desired.

A failure to hold 169.95 as support could usher in a lower test at 169.02. Continuous selling might drive bears to pull prices down to 167.74. If this level is breached, a further descent to the day’s low bear target for Apple at 166.70 is expected.

Microsoft MSFT is currently being traded around our level of 337.80. For the bullish, holding firm above 337.80 and rallying to 339.02, which should be held as support during regular trading hours, is essential. A maintenance of this key support level could trigger a bullish rally towards 340.36. Sustained buying momentum might see prices touching the day's high target for Microsoft at 341.41.

Should 337.80 fail to sustain support, a bearish probe down to 335.96 is anticipated. A breach of this level could see further testing lower at 333.46. With continued bearish pressure, a push down to the day’s low target for Microsoft at 331.24 is likely.

Following a rally from the lows, Tesla TSLA is currently being traded around our key level of 200.91. Bullish action could push prices up to 202.91, with continuous buying possibly leading to a robust rally to our key level of 204.03. A significant buyer turnout today could propel prices to the day's high target for Tesla at 206.09.

A failure to maintain 200.91 as strong support might invite a lower test at 198.62, with continued selling possibly bringing 196.54 into play. A breach of 196.54 with sellers dominating could lead to a price drop to the day's low bear target for Tesla at 195.23.

NVIDIA NVDA is currently being traded around our key level of 405.18. For the bullish, a push to 409.31 and reclaiming this level as a solid support area is sought. Bullish action could drive prices up to 411.03 and 412.23. A strong bullish stance today might see prices reaching higher to 413.76. Continued buying could rally prices up to the day's high target for NVIDIA at 416.72.

If 405.18 fails to hold as a strong support, a bearish test lower at 402.12 is foreseen. A breach of 402.12 with sellers in control could lead to a price drop to 399.46. Continued selling pressure could see the bearish target for the day at 394.89 for NVIDIA.

Final Word: The primary focus of today's session revolves around the FOMC rate decision scheduled for 2PM EST, followed by Jerome Powell's press briefing at 2:30PM EST. Expect a roller-coaster of volatility and exercise caution, especially if you're a novice trader. It's advisable to stay mostly hands-off in trading today if you're inexperienced. Best of luck if you decide to trade, and ensure to stay safe!
