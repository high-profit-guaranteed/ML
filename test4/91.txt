In fact, not owning these three companies was a roughly 400-basis point headwind to our relative results versus the Russell 1000 Growth in the first quarter. We believe Tesla also has strong competitive advantages, at least on the auto side of the business, but we currently have some questions around the company’s leadership and the magnitude of its growth prospects."
