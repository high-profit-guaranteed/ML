Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has rolled out a revamped version of the Model 3 electric vehicle in the US after a fierce price war with competitors last year.

Featuring a new aerodynamic design, Tesla said the new model could go further on a single charge than previously, at 341 miles compared to 333 miles.

Tesla has faced scrutiny over the listed ranges of its vehicles, with the company reducing estimates for how far single charges would take certain models on Tuesday.

This followed the introduction of new US regulations on vehicle testing, which are designed to ensure listed mileage ranges accurately represent real-world performance.

New Model 3 vehicles are priced at US$38,990 (Â£30,651) for the rear-wheel version and US$45,990 for its long-range alternative, meanwhile.

These include fresh internal features, according to Tesla, such as displays for backseat passengers.
