Against a backdrop of the rising prominence of Electric Vehicles (EVs), automaking giant Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) is expected to post its fourth-quarter results tomorrow. The company already reported delivering approximately 1.81 million vehicles last year, indicating a 38% year-over-year growth.

However, TSLA’s decision to cut prices on its popular Model Y vehicles, aligning with the price war it has initiated in the EV market, has weighed on investor sentiments. The stock closed its last trading session at $208.80, lower than the 50-day moving average of $237.49 and 200-day moving average of $231.68.

Furthermore, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas cut TSLA’s price target from $380 to $345, which is a significant drop. Jonas anticipates TSLA’s 2024 volume and profitability outlook to be modest.

The company also faces increasing competition from other automakers. Amid this, TSLA would have to stall production at its German factory from January 29 to February 11 as vessel attacks in the Red Sea have led to a lack of components supplied through that route.

Another question clouding the company’s outlook is Chief Executive Elon Musk stating that he would be uncomfortable growing TSLA as an Artificial Intelligence (AI) leader if he did not have 25% voting control.

Given this situation, let’s look at the trends of TSLA’s key financial metrics to understand why it might be wise to exercise caution and avoid the stock now.

Analyzing Tesla’s Financial Performance: From March 2021 to September 2023

The trend and fluctuations of the trailing-12-month net income of TSLA from March 2021 to September 2023 can be summarized as:
• None Moving through the first and fourth quarter of 2021, there is a steady increase in net income. TSLA’s net income grew from $1.14 billion in March 2021 to $2.18 billion in June 2021, then further to $3.47 billion by September, and finally hit $5.52 billion by the end of December.
• None In the first quarter of 2022, the net income ascended substantially to $8.4 billion and continued to climb to around $9.52 billion toward the end of June 2022.
• None There was a significant hike in the third quarter of 2022, where net income swelled to $11.19 billion. By the close of the year 2022 (fourth quarter), net income surged to an apex of $12.56 billion.
• None In the following year, specifically in the first quarter of 2023, there is a minor dip to $11.75 billion. However, the net income rebounded somewhat in the second quarter, reaching $12.20 billion.
• None In the third quarter of 2023, the net income again primarily lessens, settling at $10.76 billion. This marks the conclusion of the series.

From this data series, it’s clear that TSLA’s net income has been on a general upward trend from March 2021 to December 2022, with fluctuations in 2023. The growth rate, computed by assessing the final value from the first, indicates an expansion of approximately $9.64 billion. Please note that greater emphasis has been placed on more recent data in accordance with the given instructions.

The reported gross margin of TSLA indicates a general increasing trend from the start to the middle of the series (March 2021 to June 2022). This period observed the gross margin improving from 21.2% in March 2021 to a peak of 27.1% by June 2022. However, after this period, a consistent downward trend is evident, with the gross margin decreasing from 27.1% in June 2022 to 19.8% by September 2023. Key notes:
• None June 30, 2022, saw the highest gross margin in the series at 27.1%.
• None September 30, 2023, marked the end of the series with a gross margin falling to 19.8%.

The growth rate of the gross margin, taking the last value from the first value, was negative, which indicates a decrease, though there were periods of increase in the initial part of the series.

The overall trend showcases a decline in the gross margin for TSLA from mid-2022 to late 2023. This suggests an increased cost of goods sold or decreased net sales during this latter period. It’s crucial for stakeholders to monitor these shifts over time to evaluate business performance and adjust strategies accordingly.

The ROIC (Return on Invested Capital) trend for TSLA shows a fluctuating pattern over the period given. Here’s a brief overview of the trend and fluctuations:
• None Starting from a relatively low 7.1% in March 2021, the ROIC experienced a growth spurt throughout 2021, ending the year at 21%. This signifies a remarkable increase.
• None The growth rate skyrocketed in the first half of 2022, with the ROIC hitting a peak of 39.9% by the end of the year.
• None However, the trend began to decline in 2023. The ROIC fell to 33.8% in March, then further dropped to 24.7% by September, its most recent value.

In taking into account the first and last available values, TSLA’s ROIC has grown from 7.1% in March 2021 to 24.7% in September 2023, representing a sizable growth rate.

Emphasizing the more recent data, there appears to be a reverse in the previous upward trend. Transitioning from the fourth quarter of 2022 to the third quarter of 2023, the ROIC reduced, potentially indicating a negative change in the company’s profitability in this last quarter.

Here is an analysis of the asset turnover trend of TSLA based on the provided series data:
• None The asset turnover for TSLA shows a consistent upward trend from March 2021 to December 2022, indicating improved efficiency in using the company’s assets to generate sales throughout the period.
• None At the start of the series in March 2021, the asset turnover was reported at 0.76. It rose incrementally every quarter, reaching 0.94 by December 2021. This steady increase signifies a 24% growth within this period.

• None The overall positive growth of the asset turnover continued until it peaked at 1.125 in June 2023. The growth rate from March 2021 to its peak is approximately 47%, displaying a remarkable enhancement in the utilization of assets for generating sales.
• None However, the series saw a subtle fluctuation in September 2023, as the asset turnover dipped to 1.085. Although still performing significantly better than earlier periods, this suggests a slight decline in the progress seen.
• None Paying closer focus on the most recent data, the last value in the series, from September 2023, marks a decrease when compared to that of June 2023. From a broader perspective, though, it signifies a 43% growth from the beginning of the period covered by the series.

In conclusion, TSLA has demonstrated improvements in maximizing the usage of its assets to deliver sales. Despite the recent fall, the overall trend has remained positive, with remarkable growth over time.
