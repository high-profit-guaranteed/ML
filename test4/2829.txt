Tesla (TSLA) shares hit a 2024 low on Friday after Reuters reported that the EV company had canceled its long-promised next-generation $25,000 vehicle and opted to focus on developing its self-driving robotaxi platform. CEO Elon Musk claimed the story was untrue.

Reuters reported on Friday, citing three anonymous sources and internal reports, that Tesla no longer plans to make its low-cost entry-level model. Tesla will reportedly continue developing its robotaxi on “the same small vehicle platform.” A source told Reuters that Musk is going “all in” with robotaxi.

Musk turned to X, formerly Twitter, on Friday morning, claiming that Reuters is “lying (again).”

Tesla stock has plummeted in 2024, but at least it’s cheaper, right? No

In January, Tesla reported in its fourth-quarter results that its teams are working “to launch the next generation car at Gigafactory Texas” in 2024.

Tesla added that it is also “currently between two major waves of growth,” with the “global expansion” of the Model 3 and Model Y vehicle platform “and the next one which we believe will be initiated by the global expansion of the vehicle platform of the next generation. .”

“We’re very far along with our next generation of low-cost cars,” Musk said during the Q4 earnings call.

Musk added in January that Tesla wanted to start production sometime in the second half of 2025. However, Musk warned that his words should be “taken with a grain of salt.”

Last week, Tesla stock rose 2.9% to 175.79, posting a second consecutive weekly gain as the EV company began rolling out its latest Full Self-Driving (FSD) update to customers. TSLA stock is trading below its 50-day moving average.

Elon Musk emails leaked on social media platforms show that he is making it mandatory in North America to install and activate the latest version of FSD on vehicles and to take customers on a “short test drive before hand them over the car’.

Tesla is also offering a one-month free trial of FSD in the US for new purchases or existing EVs that support FSD.

According to FactSet, Wall Street currently expects Tesla earnings per share of just $2.76 in 2024. That would be a decline of more than 13% from last year’s $3.12.

Wall Street’s 2024 EPS consensus estimates for Tesla have fallen more than 27% since the end of 2023. With Tesla reporting earnings on April 23, Wall Street is likely just beginning to cut earnings forecasts. Some analysts believe earnings could fall further, possibly around 2021 earnings per share of $2.26.

Looking further ahead, Wall Street estimates that Tesla’s earnings per share will reach $3.79 in 2025, up from $5.29 at the end of 2023, according to FactSet.
