Tesla Inc TSLA CEO Elon Musk touted the abilities of its upcoming Cybertruck to tackle sandy terrain in a tweet on Sunday, spurring calls from fans for testing on dunes.

What Happened: “Would be cool to see Cybertruck tackle this,” Musk wrote in response to a video, posted by Dogecoin DOGE/USD co-creator Billy Markus, of trucks bashing sand dunes in a desert environment. Dune bashing is off-roading on sand dunes mostly done by larger vehicles.

X.com users responded to Musk’s reply and called for testing the Cybertruck on such terrain. Tesla has previously shared pictures of the Cybertruck winter testing in New Zealand. While some users seem positive the Cybertruck can drive over dunes, others wondered if the vehicle’s weight will pose an issue.

Why It Matters: Cybertruck deliveries are expected to commence later this year.

"We can't wait to start delivering it later this year," Musk said during the company’s second-quarter earnings call last month.



Production ramp of the Cybertruck, however, will go as fast as the least lucky, least well-executed element of the 10,000 unit parts and processes involved in its production, he added.

The first Cybertruck has already rolled off the production line at Giga Texas.
