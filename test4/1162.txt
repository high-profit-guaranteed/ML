Tesla Inc. is taking steps to begin operations in Chile, a country with the world’s biggest reserves of lithium but still low penetration of electric vehicles.

The company registered Tesla Chile SpA, according to a post on Chile’s official gazette dated September 28. The unit can carry out activities such as the sale and fabrication of cars and those related to “generation of energy and electricity.”
