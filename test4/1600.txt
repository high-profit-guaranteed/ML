The fight for electric-vehicle sales leadership will be a two-company race for at least the next few years, with Tesla Inc. and BYD Co. remaining well ahead of Volkswagen AG , according to Bloomberg Intelligence.

While Tesla fell behind BYD in fourth quarter sales of battery-electric vehicles, BI expects the US company to stay ahead on an annual basis through the end of the decade. VW is “no longer a contender” for the EV crown, analysts led by Michael Dean said, though they expect internal combustion engine models to keep dominating industrywide earnings.
