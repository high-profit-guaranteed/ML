In the fast-paced realm of technology and finance, a select group of companies have emerged as true giants, rewriting the rules of their industries and amassing unprecedented wealth for investors.

The meteoric rise of tech behemoths like Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is a testament to the power of innovation and game-changing products. These industry pioneers have reshaped our lives, from electric vehicles (EVs) to sleek smartphones, and their stocks have become the darlings of many portfolios.

In the below analysis, we delve into the comparison of return on investment (ROI) rates between a $100 investment in industry giants Apple and Tesla and the same amount invested in XRP, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrencies.

Put simply, if one invested just $100 in Tesla in August 2018, which became the world’s largest EV maker, their investment would be worth around $1,108 today. This means that TSLA’s annual rate of return over the past 5 years has been more than 61%, while the total profit stands at over $1,000.

Similarly, those who put $100 in Apple’s shares in August 2018 have seen their investment rise to over $345 in the past 5 years, with an annual return rate of 28% and a total profit of about $245.

Finally, crypto investors who invested the same amount in XRP 5 years ago would have witnessed a slight ROI, from $100 in August 2018 to roughly $147 in August 2023, according to CoinStats.

In light of the analysis, it becomes clear that investors who bet on AAPL and TSLA have enjoyed more robust ROI rates over the past 5 years compared to those who chose XRP.

Nevertheless, it’s crucial to recognize that these rates pertain solely to this period, and longer time frames might reveal divergent outcomes in terms of ROI.

Meanwhile, XRP was trading at $0.52, down 1.34% on the day. The cryptocurrency declined by 0.88% over the past week and nearly 27% over the month.
