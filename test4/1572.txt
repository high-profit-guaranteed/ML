In a press release yesterday, Tesla (TSLA) announced its Q4 and entire year 2023 vehicle delivery and production figures. The automaker achieved the target it set for itself — delivering at least 1.8 million vehicles in 2023.

As we reported earlier, Tesla will need to score an all-time record quarter in Q4 2023 to reach its guidance of 1.8M vehicle deliveries. The US-based electric automaker surpassed the minimum required number to reach this year’s target by more than 8 thousand units.

Tesla delivered 484,507 vehicles in Q4 2023. This resulted in a total of 1,808,581 Tesla vehicle deliveries in 2023.

Tesla’s Q4 2022 was a record quarter as well with 405,278 vehicle deliveries. Tesla has delivered 79,229 (19.5%) more units of vehicles in 2023 compared to QoQ from last year’s Q4.

Out of the 484,507 vehicles that Tesla delivered in Q4 2023, Tesla Model Y and Model 3 accounted for 95.25% of the vehicle sales with 461,538 units sold.

Although Tesla started delivering its first electric pickup truck aka the Cybertruck on 30th November 2023, the automaker did not include the number of units delivered separately. The difference in this quarter’s production and delivery figures is that Tesla merged and showed Model S, Model X, and Cybertruck numbers under “Other Models” (see Table 1 above).

So, Tesla has not yet disclosed how many Cybertruck units it has delivered in the last month of 2023. It will be interesting to see in the next few quarters if Tesla separately reports Cybertruck production and deliveries or keeps it merged with the Model S/X. I guess it all depends on its sales figures, if the number is sizable, Tesla will report it otherwise not.

Tesla delivered a total of 1,313,851 in 2022. The automaker sold 38% or 494,730 additional units of vehicles in 2023 compared to the previous year.

Despite the reported growth for the year 2023, the Tesla (TSLA) stock price has been showing a downward trend today since the market opened this morning. As of this writing, around 3:00 PM Eastern Time, Tesla’s share price is down more than 3% and fluctuating between $239 and $240.

Tesla also announced the Q4 and 2023 yearly Earnings Call date and time yesterday. Tesla will publish its financial results and conduct the earnings call on Wednesday 24th January 2024 after market close.
