• Nvidia stock has taken over Tesla as the most popular stock traded by retail investors.
• The dethroning comes as Nvidia has surged 60% year-to-date, compared to Tesla's 18% decline.
• "NVDA looks every day more like the new bellwether of general retail sentiment," Vanda Research said.

Nvidia has dethroned Tesla as the most popular stock traded by retail investors, according to a recent note from Vanda Research.

The firm found that retail purchases of Nvidia stock over a ten-day period surpassed Tesla earlier this month amid the AI chipmaker's record run.

Cumulative purchases of Nvidia stock are sitting at just under $1 billion over a 10-day period, where as Tesla stock has attracted just under $500 million in flows from retail investors.

Shares of Nvidia have surged 60% year-to-date and are up 241% over the past year as the company continues to impress investors with strong earnings growth from the sale of its H100 GPU chips.

Those returns dwarf Tesla's, with the EV-maker's stock falling 20% year-to-date and 2% over the past year.

"So long TSLA, there's a new sheriff in retail town. Given recent challenges for Musk's company and lagging shares price performance, retail investors have continued shifting their purchases progressively in favor of NVDA lately," Vanda Research said.

The dethroning is significant as Tesla has been a darling among retail investors throughout all of 2023, with investors purchasing upwards of $4 billion of the stock over a two-week period in early 2023.

The swap between Nvidia and Tesla means the AI chipmaker is now an indicator of overall sentiment among retail traders, according to the note.

"NVDA looks every day more like the new bellwether of general retail sentiment," Vanda Research said. But the stock could still have a long way to go in winning over retail investors, as some may be hesitant to buy a stock that is sitting at all-time highs.

"The 'scary' part is that despite the recent hype around anything AI and semiconductors, current retail flows into NVDA shares have merely matched the lowest point seen in TSLA stocks during 2023," Vanda Research said.
