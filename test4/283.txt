I have written several articles about Tesla’s stock price patterns (ticker TSLA).

Here is one I wrote about the January 2023 low:

And a few I wrote leading up to the April 27, 2023 low:

As we have discussed on this blog and my blog, I don’t track nor do I know ANYTHING about the fundamentals driving the any market, including the Electronic Vehicle (EV) market. I probably should as I have my hands in a “data norming” technology that is using Unreal Engine 5 to create the “EV Metaverse” but, other than that I really don’t.

That being said, the thesis that $TSLA IS GOING TO NEW HIGHS remains intact.

What will stop it… MAJOR RESISTANCE at 257-268.

Other than that… IF (the big IF) $TSLA respects that level and pulls back, THEN I’ll be thinking of adding and getting long.
