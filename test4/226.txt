Tesla Inc. plans to give an early glimpse of its revamped Model 3 sedan as part of Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk ’s first visit to the carmaker’s Shanghai factory in years, according to people familiar with the matter.

The first cars coming off the line Thursday are prototypes, the people said, asking not to be identified because the company’s plans are private. The updated Model 3, Tesla’s first mass-market sedan, is slightly longer and sportier than the earlier version and has a sleeker interior design, Bloomberg reported earlier this month.
