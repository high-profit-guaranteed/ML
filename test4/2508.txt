SEANA SMITH: Shares of Tesla are moving to the upside, another big data point out this morning, or a headline, I should say. The company raising the price on its Model Y by $1,000 next month in April. You're now looking at gains of just about 2%. We know Tesla had been slashing its prices in order to boost demand. It was a concern here amongst analysts over the last several quarters.

Evercore coming out, saying that the price rise is, quote, "likely a marketing push to sell production inventory into quarter end as Q1 deliveries appear weak." But again Tesla raising the price here by $1,000. Maybe it will help their margins. How long, though, the key price is there-- that, of course, is a question, too.

And how the rest of the industry responds, as well. Any time you see a price movement in Tesla, more often than not, GM, Ford, also Stellantis considering how they can make sure that their pricing mechanisms keep pace with the demand environment, too.
