"Tesla has its fair share of bulls – and bears – so guessing the bulls are attempting to view this earnings release as a speed bump and using any weakness here to add exposure to positions," said Todd Sohn, ETF and technical strategist at Strategas Securities.

The leveraged Direxion fund has seen net inflows of $501 million so far this year and has doubled in price year-to-date. Tesla's shares are up 72.3% this year.

Tesla was also the most-bought stock among retail traders on Thursday, with net buys of $159.5 million, according to data from Vanda Research.

Both funds climbed more than 9% on Thursday and were up 2.4% each on Friday.
