Tesla Inc. staff must now install and demonstrate the company’s driver-assistance technology before handing cars over to buyers in North America, a “hard requirement” that Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk says will slow deliveries.

Musk instructed employees to perform a “short test ride” with customers to show the system Tesla markets as Full Self-Driving, according to an internal memo seen by Bloomberg News. Workers will also have to perform checks on any vehicles returned from service.
