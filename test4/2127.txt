Despite a good week of earnings, Tuesday’s higher-than-expected consumer inflation reading sent stocks lower for the week. The S&P 500 recovered from Tuesday’s lows but ended the week -0.4%. The Magnificent 7 had a rare bad week with a decline of 1.5%, while the equal-weighted S&P 500 rose by 0.7%. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA); these stocks remain well ahead of the S&P 500 year-to-date rising 10.7% versus 5.2%.

Earnings season continues to slow, with 54 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report this week. Importantly, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) releases earnings on Saturday morning, and this edition contains Warren Buffett’s highly anticipated annual letter to shareholders. Last week, Berkshire Hathaway unveiled their stock moves for the fourth quarter, and the biggest news was additional purchases of two oil companies and the trimming of some Apple (AAPL) stock.

While January’s headline consumer inflation (CPI) reading improved to 3.1% year-over-year, the level was still higher than expected. Additionally, the details were less flattering as well. The supercore inflation level rose to 4.3% year-over-year. The supercore measures services inflation, excluding housing and energy services. The official government rental inflation is too high and lagging the actual data, so removing it should provide a more accurate picture. So, having the supercore reading moving higher raises alarms that wage inflation from the robust labor market could be seeping back into services inflation. Some dismiss the hot reading as an artifact of annual price hikes, but the possibility that inflation is flaring up will keep markets jittery until further evidence.

The question marks stemming from the hot inflation reading caused the probability of a Federal Reserve rate cut in May to plunge to less than 30%. The odds now favor the first easing of the monetary policy rate in June, with the futures market at a 60% probability.

The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to 4.28% from 4.18% last week and has risen 40 basis points, 0.4 percentage points, year-to-date. With the likely delay in Fed rate cuts, the 2-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to 4.64% from 4.48% last week and has risen 39 basis points year-to-date. The silver lining is that while markets have priced in higher short-term inflation, longer-term expected inflation remains stable, which helps reduce the damage of higher rates on the pricing of risk assets.

Counterintuitively, the worse-than-expected consumer spending and housing starts data after the CPI shock likely helped stocks. A long string of solid economic releases had sent economic growth expectations to an unsustainably high level, which added to the concern that robust economic growth might feed the flames of inflation. After the softer economic data later last week, the Atlanta Fed’s estimate of first-quarter GDP growth eased to 2.9%. Contrary to the typical pattern this year, interest rate sensitive stocks like banks, utilities, and real estate rebounded nicely despite the rise in yields and the postponement of Fed easings, while the market leaders like the Magnificent 7 underperformed.

After last week’s earnings reports, the season is nearing completion. Earnings growth has improved dramatically after the banks provided a brutally lousy start.

According to FactSet, the technology and industrial sectors were the most significant contributors to the improvement in the headline growth rate last week. The improvement in earnings was widespread, with only three sectors showing fractional declines relative to the previous week.

Among the companies coming up this week are Home Depot (HD), Walmart (WMT), and Etsy (ETSY), with Walmart particularly closely watched, with the stock at a high and its massive reach providing clues as to the health of the U.S. consumer. Additionally, NVIDIA (NVDA), a market darling thanks to its dominant position in artificial intelligence, reports earnings on Wednesday after the close.

Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, combining after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. With nominal GDP growth at 5.8% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, topline revenue growth for companies has some tailwinds. Sales growth is significantly better than expectations going into the earnings season and improved modestly last week.

After a solid performance last week, the blended earnings performance rose further above expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 3.2% year-over-year, better than the 1.6% expectation at the end of the quarter.

After last week’s elevated inflation reading raised questions about the ability of the Federal Reserve to lower short-term interest rates before mid-year, markets are likely to remain jittery and focused on any clues regarding the future path of the economy and inflation. The U.S. economic calendar is quieter this week. Still, Walmart’s earnings commentary will be combed for clues about the consumer, and NVIDIA’s will be scrutinized for indications about the demand for artificial intelligence.
