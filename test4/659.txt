As Elon Musk enjoys international prominence at the helm of electric-car titan Tesla Inc. TSLA, the narrative from some of his staff members offers a contrasting perspective of the company's inner workings.

Recent revelations from Tesla's workers shared in an Aug. 16 episode of The Verge's podcast "Land of the Giants: The Tesla Shock Wave" depict a rigorous and occasionally severe professional environment.

One unidentified staff member remarked, "What I saw was, you know, a lot of people sleeping on the floor, people working 10-12 hours a day, six to seven days a week."

Another individual highlighted Musk's unpredictable nature, sharing, "Let's say you drop something. Let's say you do something wrong. You're getting fired on the spot 'cause Elon's coming out of a room, looking dead at you, and firing you."

Musk previously acknowledged the intense work environment at Tesla, referencing an "excruciating effort â€” 100-hour weeks, by everyone."
