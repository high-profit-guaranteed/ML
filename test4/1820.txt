Gross profit as per Tesla’s unified consensus is expected at $4.5 billion, and gross margin is estimated to be 17.8%.

For full year 2024, analysts are expecting Tesla to post non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.62. Analysts are also expecting total revenues of $115.1 billion, as well as automotive revenues of $95.5 billion. FY 2024 gross profit as per Tesla’s unified consensus is expected at $21.5 billion, and gross margin is estimated to be 18.6%. The analysts’ unified consensus for Tesla’s full year 2024 vehicle deliveries is also listed at 2,161,075 units.

Wall Street veteran and The Future Fund LLC Managing Partner Gary Black, a Tesla bull, noted that metrics to watch for Q4 2023 would be the electric vehicle maker’s auto gross margins excluding regulatory credits, which Wall Street expects to be 16.7%, as well as the the company’s full year delivery estimate for 2024. Black also noted that any comments about auto gross margins excluding regulatory credits for FY 2024 would be pivotal information.

“4Q auto gross margin ex-RC (WS 16.7%E vs 3Q 16.3%) and the FY’24 deliveries guide are the two key metrics to watch, and any comments about FY’24 auto gross margins ex-RC (WS 17.8%E). TSLA mgmt has not surveyed analysts on auto gross margins in recent quarters in favor of the broader but less useful consolidated operating margin (WS 8.3%E),” Black wrote on X.
