The Bruins defeated the three-time defending state champion Raptors with a dominant second-half defense and a relentless offense. The result was a 7-3 win in the Tennessee Scholastic Lacrosse Association's Division 1 Class AA state championship Saturday at Nolensville High. The title avenged Brentwood's runner-up finish to Ravenwood in 2022.

"I don't know if I even have words," Brentwood lacrosse coach Drew Herbert said. "I've coached this senior class since they were in eighth grade. We've talked about this moment. We've played for this moment. They've fought for this moment for five years.

"The loss last year gave us the hunger and the fire to come back this season and complete the ultimate goal."

The title is Brentwood's first since 2008, when the Bruins beat Father Ryan. This one, though, wasn't an easy one. Ravenwood led 3-1 at halftime and seemed to have control.

"We weren't going to lose," Brentwood freshman Matthew Petterson said. "That's the thing. We were not going to lose."

Brentwood had an answer behind goalie Sam Boroughs, who shut out the Raptors in the second half, and Petterson, broke a 3-all tie with four unanswered goals for the Bruins (15-1). Petterson's first goal off a pass from teammate Macklin Thomas gave the Bruins their first lead with 4:01 left in the third quarter.

Thomas had two goals of his own.

Petterson, a freshman, was just getting started against the Raptors (11-8). He added his next goal with 2:42 left in the third quarter before padding Brentwood's lead with two more fourth-quarter goals to finish the season with 32, including 14 in the Bruins' last three games.

"I wanted it," Petterson said. "I couldn't let these seniors down. "It's their last year."
