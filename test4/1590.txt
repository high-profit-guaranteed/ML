Asset management firm Ark Invest founded by Cathie Wood has offloaded Coinbase (COIN) shares worth millions again amid a crypto market bloodbath on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest funds have purchased Elon Musk’s Tesla (TSLA) shares, increasing its holdings as the stock price fell over 4%.

On Jan 3, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest sold a total of 166,183 Coinbase shares worth over $25.3 million, as per trades seen by CoinGape.

Coinbase (COIN) price closed 2.96% lower at $152.24 on Wednesday. However, it gained momentum on Thursday and is trading at $158.42 at press time. But the stock remains far from its recent high of $187.39.

On Jan 2, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest sold a total of 3,360 Coinbase shares worth over $580K and 23,606 Robinhood shares worth nearly $300K.

CoinGape reported last week that Cathie Wood seems to be bearish on Bitcoin and crypto shares as the SEC is likely to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs as of January 10, considering it as a ‘sell the news’ event. Moreover, Ark Invest funds will look to continue to offload COIN shares worth millions this month as part of its active fund management strategy, extending its selloff run of the last year.
