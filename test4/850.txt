• The United Auto Workers (UAW) strike against Ford, GM, and Stellantis is a pivotal moment in the auto industry.
• Tesla, contrasting with the big three automakers, has faced legal controversies due to its non-unionized status.
• Despite facing an 8% reduction in stock value in recent days and enveloping negative publicity, Tesla’s financial outlook remains resilient, with the stock marking a 114% increase over the year.

The strike led by the United Auto Workers (UAW) against the three major automakers - Ford, GM, and Stellantis, has brought forth a significant conversation about the ongoing pursuit of shared prosperity in the highly profitable auto industry.

This effort is not solely about achieving fair wealth distribution but also a testament to the unwavering determination of workers to secure just compensation and improved working conditions in an industry that consistently generates substantial profits.

The strike highlights a crucial moment in the automotive industry, shedding light on the contrasting labor practices between the big three automakers and Tesla Inc TSLA.

As a non-unionized entity, Tesla has recently faced legal controversies, including accusations of employing illicit union-busting strategies. These strategies allegedly include the termination of employees who attempt to organize.

These revelations have not only tarnished Tesla's labor relations but have also emphasized the disparities in worker compensation.

In comparison to Ford, GM, and Stellantis, Tesla's pay scales significantly lag behind.

Tesla is facing challenges that go beyond labor relations and compensation disparities.

The company is currently dealing with a decline in stock value, which has seen an 8% reduction in recent days.

This financial setback comes after a period of strong performance, during which the stock rose by 31% between August 18th and September 15th, reaching a peak of $278.

However, the financial outlook for Tesla is not entirely gloomy.

Despite recent challenges and negative publicity, the company's stock has shown remarkable resilience, experiencing a remarkable 114% increase over the past year.

The stock's current trajectory, supported by the daily 20 and 50 simple moving averages at $255, indicates a strong foundation and the potential for continued growth and upward momentum.

After the closing bell on Thursday, September 21, the stock closed at $255.70, trading down by 2.62%.
