Tesla Inc. stands to bring in as much as $3 billion by 2030 thanks to deals with Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. for their electric vehicles to use its charging network, according to Piper Sandler & Co.

The Elon Musk -led electric-vehicle company announced the latest deal Thursday in a Twitter Spaces audio chat alongside GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra . It was Barraâ€™s first appearance on the social media site since Musk completed his purchase of Twitter late last year. Ford CEO Jim Farley announced its deal with Tesla in a similar arrangement in May.
