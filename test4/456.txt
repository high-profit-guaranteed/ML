Tesla Inc. directors, including Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk , agreed to return more than $735 million in stock awards and cash to settle an investor lawsuit accusing board members of improperly giving themselves massive compensation packages.

The directors — including Oracle Corp. founder Larry Ellison ; James Murdoch , son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch ; and Musk’s brother, Kimbal Musk — agreed to hand over the stock grants and cash for already exercised options, along with making corporate-governance changes to the way board-level compensation issues are reviewed, according to court filings.
