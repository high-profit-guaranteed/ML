It’s exactly 10 days remaining in the Cybertruck Delivery Event that is going to take place in Giga Texas on 30th November (a week after Black Friday). Tesla (TSLA) however, has already started displaying Cybertrucks at its showrooms in the United States.

Just yesterday, a Tesla enthusiast Eric Ahmed shared pictures and a video of a Cybertruck that is currently on display at the automaker’s San Diego-UTC (University Town Center), California showroom. Tesla typically calls its car showrooms Tesla Stores.

Putting a Cybertruck on display in a shopping Tesla Store just before Black Friday is a great strategy by the automaker to attract as much physical audience as possible. This will result in increased awareness about the Cybertruck as well as help with new orders.

According to Eric, the Cybertrucks showcased at Tesla Stores are production models and are intended to be delivered to early reservation-holder customers. However, until the Delivery Event is concluded, the owners of these trucks will have to wait.

A Tesla sales representative at the Tesla San Diego-UTC Mall showroom said that this is the VIN# 1200 Cybertruck. Another important information Tesla sales confirmed is that the Cybertruck has ‘Perforated Seats’. The recently launched Tesla Model 3 Highland also has ventilated seats in the front and perforated in the back.

The production quality, fit and finish of the customer delivery Cybertrucks is more than impressive. The panels are tightly joined together with minimal gaps. Tesla’s track record with panel gaps on early-production vehicles is not great but this time the automaker has silenced the critics in this area.

The shine of the stainless steel body panels is alluring. However, the Cybertruck stock wheel covers aren’t earning much praise from the Tesla Community. But these covers mainly serve as aero wheels to improve range and can be easily removed to expose the wheel design underneath.

In the past few weeks, many trucks transporting Cybertrucks have been spotted on several US highways. These trucks are also seen loading Cybertrucks from Giga Texas heading to their destinations across the country. No wonder that now they have started appearing at Tesla showrooms. But looking at them this close is undoubtedly an amazing experience.

Tesla Cybertruck went through several design tweaks and production-start challenges before it finally reached showrooms. Still, a limited number of owners will be able to receive the delivery of their dream electric pickup truck because according to Elon Musk, it will take at least 12-18 months for the Cybertruck production to ramp up significantly.

Tesla has a large back order log of 2 million+ Cybertrucks and it might take the automaker years before it will be able to fulfill these orders. However, the closest is the Cybertruck Delivery Event, when Tesla is expected to reveal all the features and specs of the truck.

A Cybertruck banner at the Tesla San Diego store confirms two more specifications, bed payload and towing capacity. Tesla Cybertruck has 2,500 lbs of payload capacity and it can tow 11,000 lbs.

A picture and info-filled X (Twitter) thread by Russell is also helpful in getting an up-close and personal look at the Cybertruck.
