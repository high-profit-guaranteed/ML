A Swedish county court issued a temporary injunction granting Tesla Inc. the right to take delivery of license plates for its cars, potentially offering the company a partial reprieve from a spiraling strike.

The monthlong walkout by members of an industrial union at seven Tesla-owned repair shops in Sweden has become a veritable storm of industrial action, with eight other unions throwing their weight behind workers’ demands for a collective bargaining agreement. That’s meant the initial action involving a share of about 130 Tesla workers may now be backed by thousands of Swedish union members.
