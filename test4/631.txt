Tesla (TSLA) shares fell after the EV maker cut prices in China again. The latest cuts are on some of the pricier versions of its Model Y. Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Pras Subramanian explains why the EV maker is making the cuts.

JULIE HYMAN: Tesla slashing prices again in China. The move by the automaker sparking concerns of fueling the bruising EV price war. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs recommends Toyota Motor, given the company's strong EV potential, amid the competitive market. But let's focus in on Tesla and what is going on there.

We already, of course, have seen a lot of back and forth price cuts in China, sparked initially by Tesla. It looks like that they are cutting the priciest models of their various vehicles, their long-range and performance versions of the Model Y are being cut according to its Weibo account.

BRAD SMITH: Model Yeah. At the end of the day here for Model Y and the SUV that they've tried to continue to make sure that they have traction with, especially at that upper end as you were mentioning within China, highly competitive market where there's a lot of EV plays. That is exhibited through some of the targets that Toyota has, which was one of the reasons why Goldman Sachs was very bullish about the potential there, saying that the targets that they've set forth, $1.5 million by 2026 in terms of their EV potential there, and then $3.5 million by 2030.

Now, if you're thinking, all right, well, what about Tesla-- now, internationally, Tesla has been looking at figures, at least as of last year in 2022, about $1.3 million. So all of these things considered and the markers that Tesla has already hit, versus some of the targets that Toyota has in China and more broadly, as well. But then additionally, the plays from Ford, the plays from GM, there's going to be a ramping-up of so much of the production of electric vehicles.

The larger question is for the pricing strategy, and that gets us back to Tesla, they may be looking through the consumer environment right now and just saying, how do we prices enough to make sure that we're in garages or that we're in driveways to pull people into an ecosystem. And then the job is just retention and keeping them there, hopefully, and that could come in a myriad of different ways. But for Tesla, at least, that seems like what's at play with the strategy right now, too.

JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. Although there are questions, to your point, about what it's going to mean for the margins here. And at least one analyst over at Evercore ISI said that these cuts in China could presage cuts in Europe and in the United States, as well. And remember, we already saw Tesla's production numbers coming out of China shipments, coming out of China, down 31% in July. So that's something to keep in mind, too, when we're looking at all of these dynamics.

And as you mentioned, the competition in the Chinese EV market is probably the fiercest of any EV market in the world right now. There are a lot of homegrown producers that-- it's just a totally different dynamic than it is here.

BRAD SMITH: And one of the parts of dynamic is also government-driven, too. There are mandates now that have been steadily increasing for the past few years for auto manufacturers to have to produce and sell a certain amount of electric vehicles. And that moves higher every single year until they get to a set percentage that the government could either stand by or move even higher from that point. But it's all in order to have more of an environmentally conscious landscape, especially when it comes to auto production and what had previously and historically all around the world been an issue within the internal combustion engine vehicles and the contribution to some of the greenhouse gas emissions there, too.
