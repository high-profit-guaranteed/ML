Elon Musk is facing a deepening crisis in the Nordic region after Tesla Inc. suffered a fresh legal setback over a labor dispute thatâ€™s also stoking investor concern, just as a union in Finland announced sympathy action against the company.

On Thursday, the electric vehicle maker was told by a Swedish court that a labor union blockade of its mail would not be lifted, pending the final decision of the case. The initial ruling means the company still cannot receive license plates, effectively pausing the delivery of cars to customers in its fifth biggest market in Europe.
