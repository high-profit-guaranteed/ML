Tesla took the number one spot in the S&P 500’s best performers on Tuesday. The EV maker said its Shanghai base did great in August.
• Tesla stock added 4.7% to its valuation Tuesday after bright news arrived from the Far East. The EV maker’s manufacturing plant in Shanghai rebounded in August with an impressive 84,159 cars shipped to clients. The figure was up from just over 64,000 in the month prior, and higher than the 76,695 delivered in the year-ago August.
• The Elon Musk-led carmaker is doing numbers this year. Thanks to an increased production capacity, more than 625,000 units have rolled off assembly lines in China, compared with about 400,000 over the same timeframe in 2022. The bump in the numbers is likely to help the company meet Wall Street’s 2023 target of 1.8 million cars manufactured.
• Tesla stock, which took the number one spot in the S&P 500’s winners list on Tuesday, has charged higher by nearly 140% this year. And what a year it’s been for the EV kingpin. A stellar Q2 report, a keenly awaited Cybertruck production kickoff, and looming EV competition in China have helped boost share price.
