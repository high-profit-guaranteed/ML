New expectations have been formed for the investors after the recent meeting of Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and PM Narendra Modi during the leader’s state visit to the United States.

“I am confident that Tesla will be in India and will do so as soon as humanly possible,” Musk said. Further adding that he is probably going to visit India next year.

Following Musk’s statement, it is expected that his ventures with India could extend beyond EVs.
