VP of Investor Relations at Tesla (TSLA) Martin Viecha just confirmed that the much-awaited Cybertruck Delivery Event invitation emails have been sent. These invites are only sent to the investors and Tesla Referral Program winners who were chosen in a random computerized draw.

Martin announced the sending of the Cybertruck Delivery Event invitation emails on X (Twitter) late in the evening, he stated:

Some of the Tesla Community members (owners, enthusiasts, and investors) have confirmed the receipt of the Cybertruck event. However, if you applied to be part of the delivery event and haven’t received your email, you should check your email’s spam/junk section — because — just in case (spam filters can be annoying sometimes).

Since, at the time of this writing, it has only been a few hours since the invitations started rolling out, your email might still be in the queue leaving Tesla servers.

Tesla had to randomly select Cybertruck Delivery Event invitees because the entire Tesla Community wanted to attend the event live. Even a large space such as Giga Texas is not enough to accommodate such an audience.

Some Tesla owners and influencers even registered their grievances about not getting the invitation to the highly-anticipated event. Martin Viecha personally answered some of the questions and concerns of the Tesla Community members.

Since Martin was getting a lot of messages and X posts in his announcement thread, he wrote the following answer to explain Tesla’s position on inviting a limited number of people to the Cybertruck event. He promised to get a bigger venue next time, most probably at the next Annual Shareholder Meeting.

I’ve been getting a lot of messages and read a lot of posts so wanted to set the record straight on random drawings to our events. As much as we’d love to bring more people, we have capacity restrictions at Giga Texas. As for our Cybertruck event, we can’t really do it anywhere else. We have millions of retail holders and a LOT of interest every time. The whole reason for random drawing is that everyone gets a chance. We had someone with 36 shares getting an invite and people with 100k shares not getting one, although each share equals one entry. If you see the usual suspects get invited, in nearly all cases, they didn’t win the random drawing, but many get in through referral program and others get in as someone’s +1. This time was no different. I will float the idea of getting a bigger venue at some point in the future for our Annual Meeting.

On the other hand, according to some Tesla owners, Tesla is even revoking some invitations. This is happening because of a leaked Cybertruck video that shows the interior and bed cover functions of the truck (watch above).

Tesla is holding some Cybertruck features and detailed specifications that the automaker wants to reveal at the Delivery Event on 30th November. Some of the specs have already been leaked. So, the company’s annoyance is quite justified.

Around 2 weeks are remaining when finally some of the early VIN reservation holders are going to get the Cybertruck delivered to them. One such low VIN Cybertruck was auctioned at the Petersen Museum last month. A lot is going to happen in these 2 weeks, so stay tuned as we provide fresh Cybertruck updates.
