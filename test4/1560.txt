Tesla just published its fourth-quarter vehicle production and deliveries report for 2023. Here are the key numbers: In 2022, the Elon Musk-led automaker reported annual deliveries of 1.31 million and production of 1.37 million electric vehicles. The new numbers represent delivery growth of 38% year over year and production growth of 35% year over year. In 2022, the company reported 40% growth year over year in deliveries from 2021. In its last earnings call in October 2023, Tesla execs offered guidance that the company would notch at least 1.8 million deliveries for the full year, a number they had revised down from a 2 million goal earlier. Analysts had expected Tesla to report deliveries of 477,000 for the year-ending quarter, according to a consensus of estimates compiled by StreetAccount as of Dec. 28. Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla but are not precisely defined in the company's shareholder communications.

During a third-quarter earnings call in October, Tesla CEO Musk said the company's Model Y entry-level SUV was likely to "be the bestselling car on Earth, but not just in revenue, but in unit volume," for the year. Tesla does not break out delivery and production numbers by individual model but reported combined numbers of: Tesla produced 476,777 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles during the quarter and reported 461,538 deliveries for these models. It didn't break down Model S or X production or delivery numbers, instead batching them into "Other Models." It produced 18,212 other models and delivered 22,969 during the quarter. In the last quarter of 2023, Tesla sold its refreshed, or Highland, version of the entry-level Model 3 sedan in some markets. In December, the company began deliveries of a small number of its newest EV, the angular and controversial Cybertruck, in the U.S.
