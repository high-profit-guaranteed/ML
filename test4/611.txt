Good Morning Traders! In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, and TSLA.

Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members during our daily Morning Call, prior to the opening of the market.

We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis:

Currently, SPY (NYSE:SPY) is trading above our pivotal point at 449.42. Should this level remain robust today, we anticipate the bulls aiming for 450.23, with sustained buying potentially reaching 451.01. Our optimistic target for the day stands at 451.61.

Conversely, if 449.42 faces a downward pressure due to intense selling, we foresee a bearish move towards 447.94. A breach of this level could further push the price to 446.31, with our most bearish target set at 445.08.

At present, the Q's (NASDAQ:QQQ) are trading below our crucial mark of 372.91. If the bulls can regain this level and establish it as a solid support, our initial target is 373.82. With added momentum, we could see 375.18 and 375.98. Our top bullish target today is 377.58.

Should the price struggle to maintain above 372.91, we expect the bears to dominate, pulling the price to 371.96. A further decline could lead to 370.91, and with significant selling pressure, our most bearish target is 370.08.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading above our significant level of 180.60. If this holds, our upward target is 181.25. If the bulls dominate, we're eyeing 182.27 as the day's peak.

However, if 180.60 faces a downward shift, the bears might aim for 179.36, with a further decline potentially reaching 178.61. Our most bearish target today is 177.31.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is trading beneath our key point of 328.52. For bullish action, we're looking at reclaiming 328.52, with strong buying potentially touching 331.24. Our top bullish target is 333.46.

If 328.52 remains unattained, the bears might push towards 326.05. With intense selling, our most bearish target for Microsoft today is 323.17.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is trading above our pivotal point of 250.25. If this remains consistent, the bulls might aim for 252.38. With strong buying, our top target for the day is 254.28.

On the flip side, if 250.25 faces a decline due to intense selling, we anticipate a move towards 248.37, with our most bearish target set at 246.16.

Final Word: Given the light data today, the session might be somewhat erratic and lackluster. Monitor relative volume for insights on trade pacing. Wishing everyone successful trading!
