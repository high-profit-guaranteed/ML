Tesla, Inc. TSLA shares are moving Monday. According to an AP News report, Tesla has filed a lawsuit against Sweden’s Transport Agency as postal workers in the country have halted the delivery of license plates.

What To Know:

According to the AP News report, the suit was filed on Monday by Tesla against “the Swedish state through the Swedish Transport Agency” because non-delivery of the plates “constitutes an unlawful discriminatory attack directed at Tesla.”

Unions across Sweden have banded together to pressure Tesla into signing a collective bargaining agreement with its 120 mechanics. More than 90% of Swedish workers are currently members of a labor union.

Meanwhile, Tesla is set to hold the delivery event of its much-awaited all-electric Cybertruck at 1 p.m. CT on Thursday at its Gigafactory in Texas.
