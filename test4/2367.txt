Headed up by controversial billionaire Elon Musk, Tesla (TSLA) is the world’s most highly valued car manufacturer and one of the more popular stocks on the US Nasdaq.

Tesla accounted for three quarters of the electric cars sold in the US in 2022, and around 20% of EVs sold across the globe in the latest figures to July of 2023. There is considerable interest locally, too, in electric vehicles such as Tesla, with sales of new electric cars in Australia tripling in the 12 months to January 2022—no doubt fuelled by increasingly high petrol costs. As of December last year, there were 80,446 electric vehicles sold in Australia to date, and some 43,924—or 54.6%—were Teslas. According to Go Auto site, the brand’s overall share of the Australian market stands at 3.9%, which may not seem like much, but is just ahead of Subaru, which has 3.8% market share.

The company’s performance over time is the envy of many. However, Tesla is not immune to the global supply chain issues that have plagued other industries—nor to disruptions related to its controversial CEO. Musk spent much of the first month of 2023 embroiled in a court case surrounding two (you guessed it) tweets in August in 2018, in which Musk boasted that he had financing lined up to take Tesla private.

Stock was down at the time and Musk’s tweets—which, had they been accurate, would have spelt a $US72 billion buyout at $US420 per share—sent the share price soaring. Once it became clear the deal was nowhere to be seen, the rally reversed and stocks slumped, prompting shareholders to sue Musk for the tweets that provoked such volatility.

Nevertheless, these drops are off extraordinary highs, and, overall, Tesla figures remain relatively healthy considering the macro economic environment. In its most recent earnings report, the electric vehicle manufacturer brought in $25.1 billion in revenue for the last quarter of 2023, which was short of analysts’ expectations of $25.76 billion in revenue. Wall Street was hoping for 73 cents a share, and instead Tesla delivered 71 cents. However, revenue increased 3% year-over-year from $24.3 billion in 2022.

On the investor call, Musk said the company was in between two major growth waves, and that vehicle volume growth in 2024 “may be notably lower” than last year’s growth rate as the company focuses on launching a new model.

In its previous earnings report for Q3, released in late October, the company made a profit of $US1.85 billion, but this was down from $3.29 billion, or 95 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue came in at $US23.35 billion—a 9% increase year-on-year.

“Tesla is an incredibly capable ship,” Musk reportedly said on the call. “Even a great ship in a storm has challenges.” He also made further allusions to war being bad for business, referring to Middle East conflict and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

As of March 2024, Tesla has a market cap of $US559 billion and shares were trading at $US178.65. Here’s what you need to know about buying—and selling—Tesla shares.
