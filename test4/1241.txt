Possible Scenarios For This TSLA Stock Option Trade

Let’s work through a couple of scenarios of how this trade could look at expiration on December 15.

- If TSLA stock trades sideways and finishes between $225 and $275, the sold put and bear call spread will both expire worthless. The total profit will be equal to the premium received of $515.

- IF TSLA falls below $225 at expiration, we will be assigned on the sold put and will be forced to buy 100 shares at $225. However, our net cost basis will be $219.85, thanks to the $515 in option premium received. That is 8.6% below the closing price on Tuesday.

- If TSLA rallies above $280, the bear call spread will suffer a full loss of $500, but this will be fully offset by the $515 premium received, leaving the trade with a small gain of $15.

Tesla, which has managed to garner the reputation of a gold standard over the years, is now a far bigger entity that what it started off since its IPO in 2010, with its market cap crossing $1 trillion for the first time in October 2021.'

The EV king's market capitalization is more than the combined value of legacy automakers including Toyota, Volkswagen, Daimler, General Motors and Ford.

Over the years, Tesla has shifted from developing niche products for affluent buyers to making more affordable EVs for the masses.

The firm's three-pronged business model approach of direct sales, servicing, and charging its EVs sets it apart from other carmakers. Tesla, which is touted as the clean energy revolutionary automaker, is much more than just a car manufacturer.

While this type of strategy requires a lot of capital, it is a great way to generate an income from stocks you want to own.

If you end up being assigned, you can start selling covered calls against the stock position.

You can do this on other stocks as well, but remember to start small until you understand a bit more about how this all works.

With any option trade, it’s important to have a plan in place on how you will manage the trade if it moves against you.

Some traders like to add a deep out-of-the-money long put to reduce risk. For example, a December 15 put option with a strike price of $200 could be purchased for around $100. Buying this put, would cap losses below $200 and reduce total capital at risk.
