Tesla (TSLA) shares were downgraded early Wednesday on expectations of disappointing first-quarter deliveries, vehicle price cuts and pessimism surrounding the market for the EV giant’s highly anticipated next-generation offering.

Wells Fargo on Wednesday downgraded Tesla’s rating to underweight, below equal weight, with a price target of 125, below 200. The company’s underweight rating is equivalent to a sell rating and the price cut represents a 30% downside risk to the current TSLA levels.

Wells Fargo expects Tesla unit volumes to disappoint following the price cuts, as vehicle price cuts have a diminishing impact on demand. The company also wrote Wednesday that it believes the economics of Tesla’s next-generation vehicle, commonly known as the Model 2, “are likely to be difficult” as a mass-market compact vehicle.

This comes after Everscore wrote on Monday that Tesla’s new, cheaper vehicle may not hit the market until 2027, with 500,000 units in 2026.

However, with Tesla shares down more than 28% through 2024, one longtime Tesla bull is still bullish on the EV leader.

Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives maintained an outperform rating with a stock price target of 315 Tesla on Wednesday. The longtime Tesla bull wrote that he expects about 430,000 deliveries in the first quarter, below the Wall Street consensus of 487,000. Ives is optimistic that deliveries will remain higher throughout the year.

Having just returned from a trip to Asia, the analyst noted that it appears that many of the price cuts “will start to taper off in the spring/summer of 2024, which is good news for Tesla and the EV industry.” “

Ives wrote that the “Tesla story is as negative as we’ve seen in recent years, when Musk and Tesla were attacked by the bears from all sides.”

“We believe shares are well overshooting on the negative front as the Tesla demand story is more in a stabilization mode heading into the remainder of 2024,” he said.

TSLA shares fell more than 2% in premarket action on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Tesla shares fell 0.1% to 177.54. TSLA remains down 12% in March.

With 2023 in the rearview mirror, the consensus among analysts now is for 2024 Tesla earnings to be below 2023 levels, signaling another year of negative growth for this growth stock.

According to FactSet, Wall Street expects Tesla’s earnings per share to be just $3.03 per share in 2024. That would be a decline of more than 2% from last year’s $3.12.

Morgan Stanley Tesla bull Adam Jonas issued an investor note last week cutting his 2024 earnings forecast for Tesla by 25%, saying the EV giant could “potentially” lose money this year.

Jonas lowered his price target on Tesla from 345 to 320, but maintained an overweight rating on the stock. Jonas also cut his 2024 earnings forecast for Tesla to $1.51 from his previous forecast of $2.04 per share, with auto gross profit margins, excluding regulatory credits, falling to 11.4%, as the analyst foresees continued demand issues for electric cars .

The EV giant ranks eighth in the 35-member IBD Auto Manufacturers industry group. The stock has a Composite Rating of 32 out of a best possible 99. Tesla stock also has a Relative Strength Rating of 11 and an EPS Rating of 68.
