In a bid to increase the affordability of its cars, Tesla, Inc. TSLA launched standard-range trims on its Model S and X. These new cars have lower miles of range compared with the original models. The Model S standard range is available at a starting price of $78,490 with a 320-mile range, down from $88,490 with 405 miles of range, while the Model X standard range is available at a starting price of $88,490 with 269 miles of range, down from $98,490 with 348 miles of range.



Tesla discontinued the trim option in 2021 and started selling only the extended range and high-performance Plaid kits.



Recently, Tesla slashed the prices of two Model Y electric cars in China to combat rising competition in the domestic market. Escalating interest rates and the withdrawal of government subsidies have resulted in weakened demand for electric cars in China and other countries.



Per the information available on the company’s website, the new Standard Range trim weighs the same as the extended range, which means the vehicles sport the same battery pack and the range is limited by a software lock. The Tow Package is available with the Model X Standard Range.



Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, hinted that the company is willing to trade margins for market share. The company also slashed the price of its basic Model Y and its lowest-spec Model 3 in the United Kingdom.



There is no information available on whether the standard range will be launched in the United Kingdom or not, but the launch in the United States raises the possibility.



During the second quarter of 2023, Tesla reported record deliveries and revenues due to price cuts on models but gross and operating margins shrunk due to higher costs involved in scaling up the production of new battery cells, the Cybertruck and other projects.
