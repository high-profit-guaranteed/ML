Tesla Inc. has resumed taking orders for its Model 3 Long Range edition with a starting price of $47,240, according to its website.

Production of the popular model was halted last year due to a backlog of orders stretching into 2023. The latest price for the electric sedan, which has a range of up to 325 miles (520 kilometers) on a charge, appears to be about 19% cheaper than when it was last available for sale.
