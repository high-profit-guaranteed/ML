Earlier this year, Jim Cramer called the Tesla Inc TSLA Cybertruck a "toy for Elon Musk fanboys" and one of the ugliest vehicles he's ever seen.

Now the "Mad Money" host is dismissing it as a tank, and singing the praises of the Ford Motor Co F F-150 Lightning, which he deems superior.

Cramer also isn't shy about letting Tesla CEO Elon Musk know his opinion via Twitter.

Musk tweeted in July that he had been driving the Cybertruck around Austin, Texas, where the company is headquartered. More and more pictures of the vehicle have been surfacing on social platforms as the EV company gears up for launch.

Cramer remains unimpressed. On the July 10 edition of CNBC's "Squawk On The Street," Cramer threw more shade at the Cybertruck, calling it a "monstrosity."

"I don't want to go too into World War II, but it looks like a tank that was used by the other side," he said.

Ford CEO Jim Farley once compared buying a Cybertruck to buying a Lamborghini, but Cramer believes it's more like buying a "Panther tank" that the Germans used in WWII.

He continued to take shots at the Cybertruck, referencing one of his retweets.

"I tweeted because I wanted to attack Musk on that ridiculous vehicle that he had, which ... I think looks a little bit like something that Fred Flintstone might have built in his spare time," he said.

It's worth noting that Cramer owns Ford stock for his charitable trust. He previously said he expects sales of the F-150 Lightning to easily outpace the Cybertruck, and reaffirmed this stance in July.

The Cybertruck, according to Musk, is on track to begin production later this year. Deliveries are expected to commence sometime in the third quarter. So far, it's one of the most anticipated vehicle launches of all time.

A week after it was unveiled in 2019, Tesla boasted that it already had more than 250,000 reservations for the futuristic-looking EV. Toward the end of last year, the total number of reservations had grown to 1.5 million.
