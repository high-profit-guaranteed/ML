Fitch Ratings' 2024 outlook for the global auto manufacturing and supply sector is neutral. Fitch forecasts improved supply chains boosting global vehicle production, but overall sales are expected to be hindered due to less robust economic conditions, particularly in the US and China. Fitch predicts a 4% increase in global sales and production in 2024. Fitch also foresees slower economic growth and higher interest rates impacting overall vehicle demand in 2024. Despite this, the existence of pent-up demand resulting from years of industry underproduction is likely to bolster sales. The normalization of vehicle pricing and product mix is expected to attract customers who were previously priced out of the market. Vehicle production has been operating at or slightly above recessionary levels for nearly three years. While Fitch does not anticipate a sales decline, sales are expected to remain below pre-pandemic levels.

S&P Global Mobility predicts 88.3 million new vehicle sales globally in 2024, anticipating a 2.8% year-over-year increase in global new light vehicle sales. The recovery in light vehicle output continues, driven by supply chain improvements and recovering demand, particularly from pent-up consumer demand. However, S&P Global Mobility expresses caution about the recovery's sustainability due to challenges such as elevated vehicle pricing, difficult credit and lending conditions, and consumer confidence fluctuations. The forecast takes into account factors like persistent interest rates, supply chain improvements, affordability issues, high vehicle prices, varying consumer confidence, concerns about energy prices and supply, auto lending risks, and challenges associated with ongoing electrification efforts. Colin Couchman, executive director of global light vehicle forecasting for S&P Global Mobility, commented:

In 2024, the automotive industry is experiencing shifts in trends. The electrification of vehicles, a dominant theme, faces a reality check as consumer adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in North America slows down, signaling a more extended journey for widespread acceptance. Meanwhile, autonomous technologies are advancing, with Level 3 conditional driving automation being adopted on certain vehicles. Chinese and Indian automakers are making strides in international markets like the EU, US, and Africa, challenging established brands like Toyota and Volkswagen. Economic uncertainties are influencing consumer spending, leading to increased demand for used cars and extended ownership of existing vehicles. The car-as-a service (CaaS) model is emerging as an alternative to traditional leasing, offering subscription-based programs with potential long-term commitments. Additionally, micro-mobility, represented by electric scooters, bicycles, and e-bikes, is gaining popularity as a cost-effective and convenient mode of transportation for short urban trips. These trends collectively signify a transformative period in the automotive industry.

Investors looking to put their money in the automotive sector can buy stocks like General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F).
