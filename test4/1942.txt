Britain’s charging network for electric vehicles (EVs) is “not fit for purpose”, researchers at Which? have found.

It is believed there is widespread dissatisfaction among EV and plug-in hybrid (PHEV) vehicle owners, with 69% of drivers complaining about the current charging network, a Which? survey showed.

A quarter of EV drivers complained about the cost of public charging, while around 73% of drivers reported experiencing faulty equipment.

Additionally, the cumbersome nature of payment methods was found to have put off around a quarter of drivers.

Sue Davies, head of consumer protection policy at Which?, said: “We know that people want to make more sustainable choices and switch to an electric vehicle, but many drivers have a lack of confidence in the public charging infrastructure, and this also risks alienating people who aren’t able to charge their EVs at home.”

Nearly nine out of 10 drivers also said they preferred contactless payments, a feature that is still not widely available, forcing many to rely on specific apps for payment.

One Which? member said: “The infrastructure is dismal. It should be as easy to charge a car as it is to buy petrol. It is infinitely more complex with different systems, paying methods, limited access and non-functioning chargers.”

In response to these challenges, the UK government has introduced new regulations aimed at improving the charging network by the end of 2024, focusing on pricing transparency, reliability and the availability of contactless payments.

In the US, Tesla’s charger, the North American Charging Standard, is considered the norm, with around 1,850 supercharger stations in operation.
