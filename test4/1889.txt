Good Morning Traders! In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.

Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.

We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis:

The SPY SPY is currently trading around the level of 487.54. For those bullish on the market, the immediate goal is to see the SPY surpass 488.83. Successfully maintaining above this figure could set the stage for a further climb to 490.11, which if sustained, could signal a stronger upward trend towards 491.70. The ultimate target for bulls today is reaching 492.39.

Conversely, if SPY fails to hold at 487.54, it may signal a bearish trend with the next focus being 486.57. A breakdown below this level would likely lead to a test of 485.71, and if selling pressure intensifies, we could see a drop to 484.60. In a significant bearish turn, the price might fall to the day's lowest anticipated level of 483.38.

The Q's QQQ are navigating around the pivotal 424.82 mark. Bulls aim to secure positions above this level, potentially elevating the ETF to a firmer support at 425.77. Should the bullish momentum persist, the next targets are 426.64 and potentially 427.32. The highest bullish objective for today is set at 428.50.

If the QQQ struggles to maintain above 424.82, it may indicate bearish control, with the immediate lower target being 424.04. Further weakness could lead to testing 423.27, and a continued sell-off might challenge the support at 422.16. A pronounced bearish scenario would see the QQQ descending to the day's lowest expected level of 420.76.

Apple's AAPL stock is currently positioned around 192.27. Bulls are hopeful for the stock to hold this ground, aiming for an upward trajectory towards 193.18. Sustaining this momentum could potentially push the stock to 193.95 and, in an optimistic scenario, to the high bull target of 194.83.

Should Apple fail to maintain support at 192.27, a bearish outlook could see the stock testing 191.57. Further downside momentum could drag the price to 190.52, with 189.44 as another critical level. In a strong bearish market, the target could be the day's low at 188.56.

Microsoft MSFT is currently trading near 407.11. Bulls are encouraged by the prospect of the stock holding above this level, with an initial target of 408.46. If this level acts as solid support, the next goal would be 409.69, with an ultimate bullish target of 410.64 for the day.

On the downside, if Microsoft cannot sustain above 407.11, the focus shifts to 406.01. A breach below this could prompt a test of 404.92, with further declines possibly reaching 402.71. The bearish scenario sets the day's low target at 401.39.

NVIDIA NVDA is hovering around the 616.03 level. For bulls, the initial step is pushing the stock to 619.63, establishing it as a new support zone. Success here could lead to further gains towards 622.18, with an optimistic target of 624.89.

If NVIDIA cannot maintain support at 616.03, bears might push for a test of 613.64. A failure here could lead to further declines to 610.36, with a significant bearish push possibly reaching 605.88. The lowest bear target for the day is set at 601.39.

Alphabet's GOOGL stock is trading around 152.94. Bulls look to maintain this level, aiming for a rise to 153.54. Sustained bullish momentum could lead to reaching a high target of 153.93.

Should Alphabet's stock fall below 152.94, it could signal bearish sentiment, with the next target at 152.27. A further drop might test 151.24, with a significant sell-off potentially bringing the stock down to the day's low of 150.41.

Meta Platforms META is positioned at 396.15. Bulls are focused on keeping the stock above this level, with an eye on climbing to 399.84. A strong buying presence could elevate the stock to 403.28, with the highest bullish target being 406.72.

If Meta cannot hold 396.15, it may face a downward trajectory to 394.35. Persistent selling pressure could see the stock falling to 391.34, with a potential bearish extension to the day's lowest target of 388.41.

Tesla's TSLA stock is currently near 186.10. Bulls are looking to propel the stock towards 189.22, with continued buying possibly leading to 191.52. A bullish market today could see the stock reaching as high as 193.81, with an ultimate target of 195.91.

If Tesla cannot find support at 186.10, a move lower to 184.10 may occur. Continued selling could bring the stock down to 182.53, with a significant downturn potentially leading to the day's bear target of 179.79.

Final Word: Today's trading session is light on data, with the Dallas Fed Manufacturing Activity report due at the start of the New York session with a 3 and 6 month Treasury bill auction later at 11:30AM EST. With approximately 50% of the weight of S&P companies reporting earnings this week, alongside the FOMC rate decision, substantial market movements from large positional trades are anticipated. Traders should remain vigilant and disciplined in their strategies. Good luck today and keep your head on a swivel.
