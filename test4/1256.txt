Tesla Inc.’s next vehicle, the all-electric Cybertruck, was on display in several US showrooms during the retail event known as Black Friday, drawing throngs of shoppers eager to see the stainless steel-clad pickup up close.

At the Tesla showroom at Westfield UTC in San Diego, a group of about 25 people crowded around the sole Cybertruck on display as others waited in line outside. Shoppers had to stand about 10 feet away from the vehicle, which was roped off, and were told they couldn’t view the interior until the first Cybertruck is handed over to a customer on Nov. 30.
