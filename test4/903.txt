Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has released its Q3 2023 delivery and production report. As per the electric vehicle maker, it was able to deliver 435,059 and produce 430,488 vehicles in the third quarter.

Specifically, Tesla delivered a total of 419,074 Model 3 and Model Y and 15,985 Model S and Model X in Q3 2023. Production-wise, Tesla produced 416,800 Model 3 and Model Y and 13,688 Model S and Model X during the quarter.

Despite falling short of the Street’s expectations, Tesla maintained that it remains on track to hit 1.8 million vehicles in 2023.

“In the third quarter, we produced over 430,000 vehicles and delivered over 435,000 vehicles. A sequential decline in volumes was caused by planned downtimes for factory upgrades, as discussed on the most recent earnings call. Our 2023 volume target of around 1.8 million vehicles remains unchanged,” the company wrote.

With these results, Tesla has now delivered 1,324,074 cars in the first three quarters of 2023. This number already exceeds the company’s 2022 results, which totaled 1,313,851 vehicles.

Tesla’s Investor Relations team has shared a compiled analyst consensus for the company’s Q3 2023 vehicle deliveries. Tesla’s IR-compiled analyst consensus stood at 455,000 vehicles, which was very optimistic considering that Tesla’s production in Q3 was slowed down by Giga Shanghai’s transition to the Model 3 Highland, which was launched in the third quarter.

Tesla’s IR-compiled delivery consensus was comprised of estimates from Baird, Barclays, Bernstein, Bank of America, Canaccord, Citibank, Cowen, Daiwa, Deutsche Bank, Evercore ISI, Exane BNP, Goldman Sachs, Guggenheim, Jefferies, Mizuho, Morgan Stanley, New Street Research, Oppenheimer, Piper Sandler, RBC, Truist, Tudor, UBS, Wedbush, and Wolfe.

During the Q2 2023 earnings call, Elon Musk also spoke of factory upgrades that would affect vehicle production in the third quarter. “We continue to target 1.8 million vehicle deliveries this year, although we expect that Q3 production will be a little bit down because we’ve got some shutdowns to for — a lot of factory upgrades. So, just probably a slight decrease in production in Q3 for sort of global factory upgrades,” Musk said.
