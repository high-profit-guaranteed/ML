Tesla (TSLA) starts Cybertruck OEM wrap service after a few months of the launch of its unconventional pickup truck.

The automaker is offering Cybertruck wraps in 11 different color options. Tesla has set the price of $6,500 for Cybertruck wrap.

As we predicted in the past, Tesla has started the official Cybertruck wrap service. Before the customer deliveries began at the end of last year, multiple Cybertrucks were spotted with different wraps around the Tesla Design Studio in Hawthorne, California.

Some of those prototype Cybertruck wraps like the blue pixel pattern and military-styled camouflage became popular in the Tesla Community. However, Tesla did not make any of those patterns available to its Cybertruck customers yet. The best you get are the Satin color ones.

Following is the list of Cybertruck wrap colors that are currently available:

Some of these vinyl wrap colors are specific to the Cybertruck and some are common with the Tesla Model Y and Model 3 wraps. Tesla Cybertruck owners can place an order for their wraps using the Tesla mobile app. However, the web version of the companyâ€™s online shop has all the colors and prices listed with details.

Currently, the Cybertruck wrap service is available only in California and in Texas at the specific stores listed below:
