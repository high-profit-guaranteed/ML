Companies like IBM (IBM) and Lionsgate (LGF-A, LGF-B) are suspending their advertising on X, formerly Twitter, due to concerns about their ads appearing next to anti-Semitic content. It comes as X Owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk endorsed an anti-Semitic post on the app. It prompted longtime Tesla (TSLA) bull Ross Gerber to say he will be swapping his Tesla for a Rivian.

Kevin Paffrath, a financial advisor, Tesla investor, and the YouTuber behind "Meet Kevin," tells Yahoo Finance that "at this point, you can't really hurt the brand anymore than Elon has already done over the last year, so as a shareholder, I'm not concerned." Paffrath argues that Tesla's stock movement is based more on interest rate movement. Paffrath does say, however, that Musk "needs a babysitter and he actually needs to listen to that babysitter. Unfortunately, he acts like that little brother that's a genius but just doesn't listen to good advice."

- Elon Musk facing growing backlash over his endorsement of an anti-Semitic X post this week. Apple now reportedly the latest company to pull all advertising from X, formerly known as Twitter, following Lionsgate, IBM, and the European Commission. The question now is whether Tesla could face problems as well.

And joining us now is YouTuber, financial advisor, and Tesla shareholder Kevin Paffrath. Kevin, thank you so much for joining us. I guess I just want to start there with Tesla, Kevin. You're a believer. I know in the, in the stock, the company, the car. I'm just curious whether you think these headlines, Elon Musk behavior here, do you think it's going to impact the brand, do you think it could bottom line hurt consumer demand for the cars.

KEVIN PAFFRATH: At this point, and first of all thanks for having me, at this point you can't really hurt the brand any more than Elon has already done over the last year. So as a shareholder, I'm not concerned. The biggest catalyst for Tesla is very simple. Rates go down, Tesla goes up. That's very simple. I believe that is the largest position in my ETF.

As far as Elon's commentary, he needs a babysitter and he actually needs to listen to that babysitter. Unfortunately, he acts like that little brother that's a genius but just doesn't listen to good advice. He's got to stop alienating folks. Remember, it's very simple what he did. He had three choices to that Jewish related tweet.

He had three choices. He could have said nothing. He could have gone to the light side where he would have said, hey, thank you for sharing a positive message about reducing hate. Or he could have responded to a hateful comment that inflamed hate. Elon chose to inflame hate. That was a mistake. That was stupid. But as far as the Tesla share price, the pain's already priced in. We know Elon is a little bit of a nut. But then again you have to be a nut to create Tesla.
