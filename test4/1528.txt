Yahoo Finance sat down with top leaders across different industries to discuss topics including the IPO market in 2024, luxury automobiles, and the housing market in the United States.

Ark Invest (ARKK) Founder, CEO, and CIO Cathie Wood discusses the IPO market in 2024, Tesla, and a spot bitcoin ETF. "Now what we're seeing is we're diversifying once again. We're adding back... some stocks that we've sold... we're looking forward to the IPO window opening again," Wood says, especially in AI, as well as other innovation spaces. On Tesla (TSLA), Wood says, "we do believe that Tesla is in the pole position to be the autonomous taxi platform in the United States." Wood adds, "the outlook is bright for a... spot bitcoin ETF and we do think it will be in January."

Automobili Pininfarina (PINF.MI) CEO Paolo Dellachà notes the "key elements" of being in "the luxury segment" as an ultra-luxury auto designer. "To stay in the luxury segment, is definitely a lot about technology, about performance. But still the key elements of Battista and everything Pininfarina... will also develop in the future, start and originates from the vision about the design," Dellachà explains. "For us, it was about embracing the future and also embracing the technology that not only allow us to have a car which is emission-free, is also allowing the car to have the highest level of performance that you can now achieve today. And this comes with electric."

Meredith Whitney LLC Founder Meredith Whitney explains the "silver tsunami" in the housing market in the U.S. "The U.S. economy is remapping itself regionally," Whitney says, "you see population migration going along the lines of economic opportunity and economic growth." "The other major demographic trend you see, is the aging of America... the 'silver tsunami' is 10,000 people a day turning 65 and by 2030, the entire baby boomer... generation will be over 65." Whitney explains that "AARP estimates that 51 percent of people over 50 downsized their home and people over 50 are 74 percent of total U.S. homeowners. So if you just take... half of that you've got about 30 million homes that should be coming on the market."

CATHIE WOOD: This year, now that we've paid our dues, interest rates are up, we think we're through the worst of it. Now what you're seeing is we're diversifying once again. We're adding back stock, some stocks that we sold. And we are looking forward, especially in the AI space but in other innovation spaces as well, we're looking forward to the IPO window opening again. We do believe that Tesla is in the pole position to be the autonomous taxi platform in the United States. I think the outlook is bright for a spot bitcoin ETF. And we do think it will be in January.

PAOLO DELLACHA: To stay in the luxury segment is definitely a lot about technology, about performance. But still the key elements of Battista and every Pininfarina we will also develop in the future start and originates from division about the design. We decided already five years ago that for us, it was about embracing the future and also embracing the technology that not only allow us to have a car which is emission-free, is also allowing the car to have the highest level of performance that you can now achieve today. And this comes with electric.

MEREDITH WHITNEY: The US economy is remapping itself regionally, and it has been since the Great Financial Crisis. So you see more growth in areas like Texas and Florida, Utah, Colorado, South Carolina. And you see population migration going along the lines of economic opportunity and economic growth.

The other major demographic trend you see is the aging of America. So what's called the silver tsunami is 10,000 people a day turning 65. And by 2030, the entire Baby Boomer population or generation will be over 65. The AARP estimates that 51% of people over 50 downsize their home. And people over 50 are 74% of total US home homeowners.

So if you just take half of that, you've got about 30 million homes that should be coming on the market. So you've got a big sort of pig through the python that will start I think later part of '24 and go on for the next several years. So that I think is what's going to be reshaping housing in America.
