Tesla reported one of its weakest earnings reports in a while, but I remain optimistic about its future.

In this video, I will go over Tesla's (TSLA 2.25%) third-quarter earnings, which reported a double miss. Still, the company did share some exciting news with regard to the Cybertruck and the energy side of the business, which should excite long-term investors.
