Experts at Bank of America have suggested that the 62% market share of the US electric vehicle market could soon be set to shrink significantly as other brands move more aggressively into the space. Over the next three years, the bank has suggested that the musk-led EV company’s market share could be reduced to as little as 18% due to competitors such as Ford ramping up their EV offerings, and reducing the cost of purchasing an EV. GM’s market share is also expected to grow significantly over the same period.

In terms of share price, Tesla has been on a roll in 2023 – TSLA has doubled in value since the start of the year and is currently sitting in the region of $256 per share. Even since the beginning of the month its share price has risen by more than 25%, after having suffered heavy losses in the second half of 2022. As for where the rest of the year will take it, analysts are fairly confident that there could be more upside to come this year for the EV brand.

Tesla, founded by Elon Musk in 2003, is a pioneering American electric vehicle (EV) and clean energy company. Tesla's flagship product is its line of electric vehicles, which have gained immense popularity for their impressive performance, extended range, and sleek designs. Models like the Tesla Model S, Model 3, Model X, and Model Y have redefined the perception of electric cars, proving that they can be both environmentally friendly and technologically advanced. Beyond electric vehicles, Tesla is actively involved in the development of sustainable energy solutions. The company produces energy storage products like the Powerwall and Powerpack, which enable homes and businesses to store renewable energy for later use.
