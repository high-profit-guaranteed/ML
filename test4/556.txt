Benzinga examined the prospects for many investors' favorite stocks over the last week — here's a look at some of our top stories.

The three major stock indexes notched weekly gains, with the Dow Jones breaking a 13-day winning streak, a record since 1987, finishing 0.66% higher, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rose by 1.01% and 2.02% respectively. Despite a dip on Thursday, the indexes rallied on Friday, closing the week positively.

In response to a persistent core inflation rate of 4.8%, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised the federal funds rate to between 5.25% and 5.5% — the highest since 2001 — with the possibility of another hike in September. Despite these changes, the U.S. economy is showing resilience with a surprising 2.4% annual growth in Q2 2023, offering hope to evade a potential recession.
