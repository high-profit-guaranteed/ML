PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: So we're going to stick with-- with movies and not superheroes here, with Elon Musk. So apparently, the Musk biography, penned by Walter Isaacson, is going to be basically made into a movie. A24, the super hot studio, is going to-- going to do this with apparently Darren Aronofsky, director du jour, director auteur, "Requiem for a Dream," "The Wrestler," "Black Swan," "The Whale," among others. A true director's director.

So much so that Musk tweeted about this news and said, responding to it, saying, quote, "Glad Darren is doing it. He's one of the best." So good-- good thing that Musk is happy here. But the question is-- is I have to see this movie because of work probably. You guys maybe. But also, who's going to play Elon?

ALEXANDRA CANAL: That's a big question. When I first heard this story, I said, you know what, Elon Musk should be played by himself. Like, I could see him getting some acting classes.

JOSH SCHAFER: That's a quick way for me to not watch the movie.

JOSH SCHAFER: That's like an instant way I don't watch the movie.

ALEXANDRA CANAL: And then realistically, there's some funny things floating around on the internet. There's Rami Malek, potentially. We were talking about it in the newsroom. Christian Bale is very method.

JOSH SCHAFER: Christian Bale would be good. Like, Christian Bale, yeah, I was going to say.

JOSH SCHAFER: He's a great actor that can, like you said, sort of method act in a way and get into someone's head. And if you could talk at that pace of Elon, and I think that could be interesting. Nic Cage would be funnier. I like that one [? also. ?]

ALEXANDRA CANAL: And it could be Nic Cage's comeback as Elon Musk.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I mean, I like Rami Malek. I think that's a good, safe choice. You know, you got people like Michael Fassbender who played Steve Jobs, right? You know, I don't know-- that might be pushing it. But I think Elon Musk playing himself is too-- is too hilarious. It's too funny.

ALEXANDRA CANAL: Probably. And he's going to make an appearance. He is-- he loves himself so much that he's going to be a featured guest of some sort, even if it's behind the scenes. He's making his way into the movie.

JOSH SCHAFER: Is it too early for the movie in his career, when you think about the fact that, like, say, the book's coming out, right? The whole X thing isn't really even in the book.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I mean, look at-- look at the "Social Network" with Zuckerberg. I mean--

ALEXANDRA CANAL: That's true, which is one of my favorite movies.
