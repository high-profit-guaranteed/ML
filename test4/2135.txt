As investors look to balance portfolios for 2024, some turn towards the auto industry and one of the Magnificent Seven components, Tesla (TSLA). The EV maker has been met with a variety of challenges ranging from leadership, strikes, and recent recalls, but is the stock at a good value to buy in or are there other potential plays investors should be adding over Tesla?

Gabelli Funds Portfolio Manager Brian Sponheimer joins Yahoo Finance Live alongside Senior Autos Reporter Pras Subramanian to discuss where investors should keep an eye out in the auto industry to boost their portfolios.

Sponheimer gives advice to investors on what they should consider when weighing their options with investing in Tesla: "You're talking about a company that you really need to have confidence that there's a piece of the Tesla story that goes well beyond traditional auto-making. The stock is going to earn somewhere between $3.00 [or] $3.50 or $4.00 for this coming year. And if you're thinking about a stock trading just below $200, what are you going to be paying 45 or 50 times earnings for?"

- As a value investor that Gabelli Funds focuses on, when do the automakers look interesting for you guys as an investment?

BRIAN SPONHEIMER: It's a really good question. You know, automakers traditionally have been cheap from a statistical standpoint. We're really looking for what the catalysts can be for these stocks over the course of the next five to 10 years. I think you have to look in terms of initially price. And you know, it's hard to it's hard to say that GM at five times earnings or Ford at six times earnings is expensive.

But the real question as a value investor you have to ask yourself is when do when do you just say it's cheap for a reason? And I think I'm not ready to say that exactly. But I think given the amount of capital investment that needs to come into these industries over the course of the next five years, given the lower margins we're going to see.

I mean, Ford to their credit is showing the amount of investment and negative income that comes from the Ford E movement, I think it's difficult as a value investor to really say right now that this is the right time. The shareholder take a 20% dip, that that might change just from a trading perspective. But we are really looking for catalysts in stocks, and it's hard to see that right now for the traditional automakers.

- So should investors be buying the dip, per se, in Tesla at this juncture?

BRIAN SPONHEIMER: Tesla is a really interesting situation. You know, again, we are a value investing community at Gabelli, and you're talking about a company that you really need to have confidence that there is a piece of the Tesla story that goes well beyond traditional automaking.

Stock is going to earn somewhere between $3 and $3.50 or $4 for this coming year. And if you're thinking about a stock trading just below $200, what are you going to be paying 45 or 50 times earnings for? Is it for a decelerating top line in a traditional auto business? Is it for the potential down the road for there to be robo taxis? Is it for AI?

So while Tesla shares have declined over the course of the last year or so, we're not necessarily ready to say that it is a value stock. It's certainly become more interesting at these levels than it has been in some time. And I do think that for a company that is going to be the leader in electric vehicle development over the course of the next decade, there are some really exciting things going on.

But can't definitively say that there's a price that I'm loving diving to Tesla unless I really believe that there is an AI story here that I want to invest in.

- Yeah. Well, certainly here, when that excitement turns into earnings and realization there is what a lot of investors are going--

- Yeah, exactly. Two different things there. Brian Sponheimer, who is the Gabelli Funds portfolio manager and our own Pras Subramanian. Thanks so much for the conversation. Appreciate it.

BRIAN SPONHEIMER: I thank you very much for having me.
