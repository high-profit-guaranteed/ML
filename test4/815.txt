Tesla has announced that it has produced its 5 millionth electric car this week – a milestone that many naysayers thought impossible not so long ago.

I’ve been reporting on Tesla long enough to remember the days when most people in the auto industry thought Tesla would never be more than a niche manufacturer, and that was those who thought it would survive. Many didn’t.

The road wasn’t easy, but the automaker eventually built its first million electric vehicles; Tesla achieved that milestone in early 2020.

It took Tesla 12 years of operations to build its first million vehicles.

In the last three years since achieving the milestone, it built 4 million more.

Today, Tesla announced that it produced its 5 millionth car:

Tesla made the announcement just six months after announcing it built its 4 millionth electric car.

Prior to that, it took the automaker seven months between its 3 millionth and 4 millionth electric cars.

Here’s how Tesla currently lists its annual installed production capacity:

The automaker has warned that its production would actually go down a bit in Q3 because of factory upgrades, like a short shutdown at Gigafactory Shanghai to produce the new Model 3.

But the automaker is also soon going to add to that capacity column with Cybertruck production starting soon.
