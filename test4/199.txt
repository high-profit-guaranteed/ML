Tesla, SpaceX, and Twitter CEO Elon Musk is expected to kick off The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit on Tuesday at 2 p.m. ET. He is expected to attend the event virtually.

At the event, Musk is expected to face questions about his leadership of several companies, from EV leader Tesla to social media platform Twitter. His insights would be quite interesting considering that he has been extremely busy over the past months, particularly as he attempts to turn Twitter into a profitable business.

Musk’s upcoming virtual appearance comes less than two weeks after he disclosed plans to step down from his role as Twitter’s CEO. He will be replaced by NBCUniversal’s former head of advertising, Linda Yaccarino, an industry veteran. At the WSJ event, Musk is expected to be asked about his plans for the social media platform, among other topics.

Musk’s involvement with Twitter has had a mixed reception from investors and analysts. Some have praised his willingness to shake up the company, while others, including longtime TSLA bulls, have expressed concern that he is spreading himself too thin. Based on Musk’s comments, however, it would appear that he is making some headway toward his goals for his companies.

For example, Musk has noted that Twitter is now on track to break even. And with Yaccarino as its new CEO, the social media platform might have a shot at becoming profitable, a feat that Twitter has not been able to accomplish since 2019. Over at Tesla, Musk has also gained some approval from the company’s shareholders following the successful 2023 Cyber Roundup, the EV maker’s annual shareholder meeting.

During the event, Musk noted that Tesla would be implementing third-party audits on its battery suppliers to ensure that the materials used for the company’s car batteries do not use child or forced labor. He also confirmed that Tesla has two products in its portfolio that have the potential to see an output of 5 million units per year together. More importantly, Musk also noted that Tesla would start advertising to reach a broader consumer base.

Apart from Musk, The Wall Street Journal’s CEO event is expected to host a number of other key personalities. These include Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher, and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, among others.
