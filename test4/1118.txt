In the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, the eccentric meme-lord billionaire showed the vehicle can’t be pierced by an arrow.
• Tesla stock gained 2.4% Wednesday after CEO Elon Musk uncovered juicy insights about the keenly-anticipated Cybertruck. Roughly 200,000 units are likely to be rolling off the assembly line every year. What’s more, the meme-lord and Technoking of Tesla (Musk’s formal title at the EV company) revealed there would be a “beast mode” Cybertruck version that goes from 0 to 60 miles per hour in under three seconds.
• The boxy vehicle, made out of ultra-hard 30X cold-rolled stainless steel, is obviously strong enough to stop an arrow from penetrating its doors. That became clear when Elon Musk sat with Joe Rogan for an episode of his podcast. Further, Musk confirmed that customers could buy bulletproof glass to pair with the by-default bulletproof panels.
• The Cybertruck has been an inflection point for a while after Musk threw investors off saying the new model could take up to 18 months to churn out a profit. “We dug our own grave with Cybertruck,” the Tesla boss said on the company’s earnings call last week. On the demand front, more than 1 million people have reserved a unit.
