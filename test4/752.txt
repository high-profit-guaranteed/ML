A Tesla Inc. TSLA vehicle caused a prolonged traffic disruption when it stopped working in the middle of a busy road, refusing to budge for over nine hours, Business Insider reported.

The Tesla Model 3 abruptly stopped while attempting to turn off a road near Salisbury, England on Tuesday.

Despite concerted efforts from road workers and the police to move the car, the vehicle remained stationary at the busy junction for hours.

Matt Grigg, a local pub landlord, informed the media that the car still showed charge but refused to start. The obstruction caused significant delays throughout the day until the vehicle was eventually moved to his pub for charging.

This incident echoes similar Tesla breakdowns reported in the past, including a case in May when a Tesla vehicle broke down in a McDonaldâ€™s drive-thru in Ottawa, Canada and in September of the previous year, when a Tesla owner got locked out of his Model S after the battery died.
