Tesla, Inc. TSLA stock has pulled back about 14.7% from the pre-earnings level of $291.26 and has been between the $210 and $265 levels since then.

What Ails The Stock: The downtrend was set in motion by the man himself. Tesla CEO Elon Musk set off worries concerning further margin erosion by stating in the second-quarter earnings call that a rising-rate environment could necessitate more price cuts.

The string of price cuts Tesla has announced since the start of the year have led to a decline in automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits. The metric tumbled from near 30% at the start of 2022 to 18.1% in the second quarter of 2023, data from FactSet showed, Investor.com reported.

Despite the price cuts, volume growth proved elusive for Telsa in some key geographies such as China and Europe. In China, Tesla was a victim of the price war it started, as domestic manufacturers, such as BYD Company Ltd. BYDDY BYDDF, followed up with their own price cuts.
