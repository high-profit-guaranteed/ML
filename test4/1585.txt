Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock is a hot topic on Thursday as investors in the electric vehicle (EV) company react to news of Cathie Wood buying more shares.

In a series of purchases on Dec. 20 and Jan. 3, Wood picked up 216,000 shares of TSLA stock. These shares were bought through her investment firm, Ark Invest.
