The company's extensive fast-charging network, the largest of its kind in the world, has been crucial to its success in the electric vehicle market . Strategically located along major routes and close to amenities, Superchargers offer a seamless charging experience for Tesla drivers, with select locations recently opened to EVs from other manufacturers.

Using a Supercharger is as simple as plugging in and letting the charger handle the rest. The Tesla app allows users to view Supercharger stall availability, monitor charging status and receive notifications when their vehicle is ready.

Tesla's current Superchargers can charge at a rate of up to 250kW and the recently spotted V4 Superchargers may bring even faster charging.

Tesla's extensive network of fast chargers, combined with automatic battery preconditioning and the exceptional range of its vehicles, ensures drivers spend more time on the road.
