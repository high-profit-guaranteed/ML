Tesla Inc TSLA enthusiasts are speculating Ford Motor Co F might be the "major OEM" Tesla CEO Elon Musk mentioned during the company's second quarter 2023 Earnings Call.

What Happened: Musk announced Tesla is in preliminary talks with a major automaker to license its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology. This follows Musk's previous assertion that Tesla is open to licensing either Autopilot or Full Self-Driving, along with other proprietary technologies.

As reported by Teslarati, many Tesla fans have been curious about which automaker Tesla might be in discussions. This speculation was further stoked when a Twitter poll conducted shortly after Musk's announcement showed an overwhelming number of respondents who pointed to Ford as the likely candidate.

Why It Matters: Ford's possible involvement is of particular interest given its past collaboration with Tesla. Ford was the first automaker to adopt Teslaâ€™s North American Charging Standard (NACS) connector, followed by General Motors.

Contrary to these speculations, automakers such as Mercedes-Benz and General Motors, which already have established self-driving systems, may choose to continue the development of their own technology.

Mercedes-Benz's Level 3 system has received approval for operation in certain areas, while General Motors' Super Cruise program has been relatively successful.

Rivian is generally considered not to fit the description of a "major OEM." So, it remains to be seen which automaker Tesla is indeed in discussions with for its FSD technology.
