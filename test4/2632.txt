Ark Investment Management, led by Cathie Wood, continued to buy Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares on Monday, even though the stock had already rebounded and outperformed the broader market.

What Happened: Through its two ETFs, Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) and ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSE:ARKW), Ark bought 163,421 Tesla shares, valued at $28.21 million.

Tesla ended the day up 1.05% to $172.63, while the S&P 500 fell 0.31%, according to Benzinga Pro data.

This gain came despite a downgrade from Mizuho Securities‘ Vijay Rakesh, who switched the stock from Buy to Neutral due to concerns about the near-term electric vehicle market. Some Tesla bulls, including Gary Black, have also expressed concerns about a potentially weak first-quarter deliveries report.
