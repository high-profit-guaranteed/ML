• None Institutions' substantial holdings in Tesla implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price
• None 44% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders
• None 14% of Tesla is held by insiders

If you want to know who really controls Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 43% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).

And institutional investors saw their holdings value drop by 12% last week. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 1.6% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Institutions or "liquidity providers" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Tesla, which might have negative implications on individual investors.

Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Tesla, beginning with the chart below.

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Tesla?

Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.

Tesla already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Tesla's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.

Hedge funds don't have many shares in Tesla. The company's CEO Elon Musk is the largest shareholder with 13% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.0% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 5.6% of the company stock.

A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.

While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.

The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

Our most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Tesla, Inc.. Insiders own US$111b worth of shares in the US$764b company. That's quite meaningful. It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently.

The general public-- including retail investors -- own 43% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks for example - Tesla has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.
