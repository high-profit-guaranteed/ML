Tesla (TSLA) shares lost ground on Monday after the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) reported the EV maker sold 74,073 China-made EVs in September, down 10.9% from a year ago.

The drop from August was 12%. That followed record-setting deliveries of China-made vehicles in the second quarter of the year. Tesla produces its two lowest-priced EVs, the Model 3 and Model Y, in China, and intends to introduce a higher-priced version of the Model 3 there, which it plans to start delivering in the current quarter.

Last week, the company reported it delivered 435,000 vehicles worldwide in the third quarter, below analysts’ expectations as planned downtime for factory upgrades disrupted production.

While Tesla’s sales slumped, deliveries of Chinese rival BYD’s lineup of EVs and hybrids jumped 42.8% year-over-year to 286,903.

Shares of Tesla finished 0.3% lower on Monday but have more than doubled in value so far this year.
