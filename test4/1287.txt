The word infrastructure brings to mind images filled with roads, bridges, water supply mechanisms, transportation networks, and advanced manufacturing. However, in recent years, for many across the world, the definition of the word has changed. In a developed economy like the United States, where more than 90% of people have access to the internet, and high-tech services make a major contribution to local economies, development of basic infrastructure for access to these services has become of paramount importance. For example, think of the manufacture of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) phones, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) superchargers, and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) semiconductor chips.

Tech-based infrastructure is one of the key areas where the United States is lagging behind the rest of the world. China is aggressively deploying 5G towers to improve coverage, investing heavily in the manufacture of the latest chip technology, and scaling up smartphone production to expand presence in foreign markets. These developments are seen with rising concern in Washington. At the start of the Biden presidency, a $2 trillion infrastructure plan was proposed and later approved. As part of this plan, the US government pledged $650 billion for infrastructure, $620 billion for transportation, $580 billion for research and development, and $400 billion for a caretaking economy.

The numbers certainly reflect the changing priorities of the government when it comes to long-term infrastructure plans. However, since the US is also lagging behind other countries in the development of roads, airports, and water supply networks, the Biden administration also pledged to rebuild traditional infrastructure along with the modern one to improve the standard of living in the country and help local businesses. The hundreds of billions in federal funds for this purpose are now beginning to roll out to companies working in the infrastructure field, per reports from news platform NBC News. Experts predict that these funds will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs for the American economy.

Hiring for these new jobs is likely to begin as early as next year and ramp up through 2025 and 2026, per the Association of Builders and Contractors, a trade group representing the commercial and industrial construction industry. Jim Umpleby, the CEO of construction firm Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), said in a recent earnings call that the company was continuing to experience robust growth and now expected results of the present fiscal year to be better than expected, driven by favorable price realization and volume growth. He added that positive momentum was likely to continue for the construction industry in North America.

The infrastructure boom comes amid a shortage of workers in the construction sector. Investors should keep an eye on this development. Of the 500,000 unfulfilled construction jobs this year, most were in fields like welders, electricians and broadband technicians. Ben Brubeck, a national trade leader, believes that all this competition for skilled workers could result in projects being delayed and costing more because of higher wages, on top of material costs that are already up 40% since before the coronavirus pandemic. Brubeck noted there won’t be enough labor in certain markets to complete large projects on time. He also added that taxpayers would not be getting the best bargain for their investments in such a scenario.
