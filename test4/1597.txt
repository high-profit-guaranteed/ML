The ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), spearheaded by ARK Invest under the leadership of Cathie Wood, stands as the premier actively managed fund. Demonstrating a remarkable ability to outperform the market, the advisory firm, in contrast to many stock pickers, boasts an impressive track record.

Ark Invest, after a period of cutting and waiting, is expanding its Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) holdings, acquiring 105,201 shares valued at approximately $25 million. The strategic move spans Ark’s Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) and the flagship ARKK, with the latter securing 91,194 TSLA shares.

That being said, Ark Invest has increased its TSLA holdings for the second time in recent weeks, acquiring approximately 111,000 shares on December 21, followed by an additional 105,201 shares.

This move aligns with TSLA’s 2023 delivery and production figures, with 1.81 million vehicles sold throughout the year, including 484,507 in the last quarter, meeting Wall Street forecasts.

Moreover, in April of last year, Ark Invest projected TSLA’s shares to reach $2,000 by 2027, anticipating a valuation surge driven by the widespread adoption of the company’s yet-to-be-launched robotaxi service. This could bode well for the ETF’s gains.

Analysts anticipate significant growth in eight stocks within the ARK Innovation portfolio, projecting a 50% or more increase in the next 12 months. Overall, analysts have expressed favorable views on Wood’s selections in the 34-stock portfolio, foreseeing an average gain of nearly 30% across these stocks within the same timeframe.

Furthermore, Ark Invest, vying for a bitcoin ETF spot, awaits the SEC’s decision. Cathie Wood is optimistic, foreseeing approval in January. Despite potential short-term selling post-approval, she believes institutional investments attracted by ETFs will sustain and uplift bitcoin prices in the long run, characterizing the outlook as bright.
