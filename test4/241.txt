Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) sold 77,695 China-made vehicles in May, including exports, according to data released today by the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA).

That's up 2.44 percent from 75,842 vehicles in April and up 141.55 percent from 32,165 vehicles in the same month last year.

Tesla has a factory in Shanghai that produces the Model 3 and Model Y. The vehicles produced at the factory are supplied to local consumers and also exported.

From January to May, Tesla sold 382,859 China-made vehicles, up 77.37 percent from 215,851 units in the same period last year, according to data monitored by CnEVPost.

Tesla's China-made vehicle sales in April included 39,956 units delivered in China and 35,886 units exported. The breakdown figures for May are expected to be available in the coming days.

Tesla's pattern is to produce cars for export in the first half of the quarter and for the local market in the second half.

Production of Tesla's revamped Model 3 reportedly saw new progress at its Shanghai plant in May, and the plant is exporting vehicles to cover more markets.

Tesla was nearing the final stages before starting trial production of its revamped Model 3 sedan in Shanghai, a Bloomberg report on May 16 said, citing people familiar with the matter.

The updated Model 3 is slightly longer, sportier and has a sleeker interior design than earlier versions, those people said, according to the report.

On March 1, Reuters reported that Tesla was working to retool its Shanghai assembly plant for the updated version of the Model 3, a project codenamed Highland by Tesla.

The Highland version of the Model 3 is expected to go into production in Shanghai in September, the March Reuters report said, citing a person familiar with the matter.

On May 23, Reuters reported that Tesla listed Model 3 and Model Y models made in China for sale in Canada, confirming that it had completed its first shipments to North America from its Shanghai plant.

Tesla and other electric vehicle makers have a cost advantage in China, and the export to Canada opens up a new market for Tesla Shanghai, the Reuters report said.

The company has designed and tested Model Y cars for export to North America and aims to produce nearly 9,000 for export this quarter, the report said, citing a Tesla production plan.
