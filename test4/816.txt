Rising inflation and persistent rate hikes have finally started to show their real effects. As inflation eats into the savings of millions of Americans, their ability to pile into stocks, which went through the roof after the pandemic and caused an unprecedented rise in meme stocks and overall retail investing space, is subsiding. Last month a Bloomberg report cited a survey from the American Association of Individual Investors. The survey showed that individual investors are on the retreat while institutional investors have been piling into stocks. Bearish sentiment took over bulls for the first time since June, according to the survey. According to the survey, investors with a bearish view of the stock market for the next six months jumped to 35.9%, while those with a bullish view fell to 32.3%.

The overall stock market performance in August remained dismal, which caused retail investors to flee the markets and pull out their funds. On the other hand, according to data from Bloomberg, courtesy of Bank of America, institutional investors and hedge funds bought $4.4 billion worth of shares in a single week in August, which was the largest inflow in two months among the clients of Bank of America.

The report said that while individual investors fled the markets, they remained excited about Nvidia and Apple, along with some other mainstream companies that have become very famous on Reddit.

However, chances are that individual investors will come back to the market once the doubts around the Fed’s future policy on inflation are cleared and inflation begins to recede. The Bloomberg report cited Citigroup Inc.’s Scott Chronert, who said that if S&P 500 falls to 4,200-4,300, an attractive entry point could be created for investors. The report also quoted HSBC Holdings Plc strategist Max Kettner, who said that he was awaiting a “renewed selloff to scale up the firm’s US equity exposure.”

“…On the second half, there is going to be -- we're probably going to spend RMB4 billion or RMB6 billion further. I think -- we think that this potential upside or increased spending will be a good news for everybody. Why it's good news? Because this is driven by the progress of some incremental pipeline project, new project, which company is optimistic to obtain in the second half of this year. And these pipeline projects may bring better revenue and EBITDA for future years. Not necessarily this year 2023, but future year in 2024 and '25, beyond previous estimate. In addition, and a large -- a significant portion of this incremental pipeline projects, again not the projects we have disclosed, these projects are actually driven by our overseas business. In other words, overseas projects will have a larger-than-expected shares and that basically means the increase of the unit CapEx accordingly. So obviously, the timing of the spending may vary around late 2023 or start of -- beginning of 2024. So part of the $1.3 billion you saw in those privatization documents and a very small part of it, may be a carryover 2024 to spend. But on an aggregated level, if you combine 2023 and 2024 CapEx together, it should stay the same.”
