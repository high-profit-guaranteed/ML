Electric vehicle juggernaut Tesla Inc TSLA has successfully secured a permit for its ambitious diner coupled with a Supercharger station in Los Angeles.

What Happened: Tesla’s plan for a unique diner experience paired with supercharging facilities has received the green light from the LA Department of Building and Safety, according to a Teslarati report.

The forthcoming establishment is slated to find its home at 7001 W Santa Monica Boulevard.

The project’s architectural design is attributed to Stantec Architecture from Chandler, Arizona, while PCL Construction Services Inc. has been named as the contractor responsible for its realization.

Dubbed by CEO Elon Musk as a fusion of “Grease meets The Jetsons,” this innovative diner is set to serve as a dual-purpose venue, combining an eatery with Tesla’s signature Supercharger technology.

Why It Matters: The roots of this futuristic venture trace back to January 2018 when Musk first floated the concept of a drive-in restaurant in LA.

In a tweet, he laid out his vision, stating, “Gonna put an old school drive-in, roller skates & rock restaurant at one of the new Tesla Supercharger locations in LA.”

Fast forward to March of this year, Tesla showcased an artist’s rendition of the diner establishment at its investor day. The visualization unveiled a rooftop patio, classic drive-in movie screens, and charging ports, painting an exciting picture of the anticipated attraction.
