Tesla Inc. TSLA CEO Elon Musk made a rather tongue-in-cheek comment on Friday on the Cybertruck.

What Happened: The Cybertruck has a distinct tank-like design which is hard to miss in wraps or even in body covers.

“How do people keep figuring out that it's a Cybertruck under the cover!?,” Musk wrote on X, formerly Twitter. He was responding to a Cybertruck enthusiast who had shared a seeming drone shot of the vehicle under cover in the outbound lot at Giga Texas.

While most cars are endoskeleton-based, the Cybertruck is an exoskeleton-based vehicle made of cold-rolled stainless steel. The "radically new," "futuristic" design was derived initially from movies, sci-fi and video games by Musk after finding conventional truck design “boring,” his biographer Walter Isaacson previously said.

Why It Matters: During Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting in May, Musk said that a delivery event for the Cybertruck will be held later this year. He added that it would be the vehicle he drives on a day-to-day basis and that he expects to sell 250,000-500,000 units every year once production is fully ramped up.

Earlier on Friday, Musk also teased the ‘performance Cybertruck,’ seemingly a version of the vehicle. “I just drove the performance Cybertruck today and it kicks ass next-level,” Musk wrote.
