What's Next: Tesla said it is between growth waves, with the first wave being the expansion of the Model 3 and Model Y and the next one being the global expansion of a next-gen vehicle.

"In 2024, our vehicle volume growth rate may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023, as our teams work on the launch of the next-generation vehicle at Gigafactory Texas," the company said.

Tesla said it remains focused on growing its output.

"We are focused on bringing the next-generation platform to market as quickly as we can."

The ramp of Cybertrucks is expected to take longer than previous Tesla models due to its "manufacturing complexity."
