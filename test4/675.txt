If we want to find a potential multi-bagger, often there are underlying trends that can provide clues. Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) we really liked what we saw.

For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Tesla, this is the formula:

Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) รท (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)

0.20 = US$13b รท (US$91b - US$28b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).

Therefore, Tesla has an ROCE of 20%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Auto industry average of 12%.
