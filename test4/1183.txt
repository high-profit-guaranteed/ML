If you are a consumer looking to purchase a new Tesla Inc TSLA car, you can no longer avail of a discount on having a referral code. Instead, you may get 6 months of free supercharging depending on which Tesla model you have your eyes on.

What Happened: Tesla has removed the $250 discount the buyer gets on having a referral code. Instead, Model 3 and Y buyers will get 6 months of free supercharging with 3 months of full self-driving capacity. Buyers of the more premium Model S and X vehicles will receive merely 3 months of FSD capability.

However, six months of free supercharging could lead to savings of over $250 for new Model 3/Y drivers depending on how much they drive.

Referrers, meanwhile, will continue to get 10,000 credits irrespective of which vehicle the buyer chooses.

Why It Matters: Tesla has been constantly shaking up its referral program, incentives and rewards, leaving little room for prospective buyers and referrers to hold their decision to buy a new car or use their credits for an offer.

In summer earlier this year, buyers who purchased the Model S and X with a referral code got a $1000 discount while those who bought a Model 3 or Y got a $500 discount.
