Tesla Inc. is slashing prices of its best-selling vehicle in a bid to clear its biggest-ever stockpile.

The company is marking down Model Y sport utility vehicles it has in inventory, with the rear-wheel drive version going for $4,600 less than the cost to custom order the sport utility vehicle. Long-range and performance Model Ys are discounted by at least $5,000.
