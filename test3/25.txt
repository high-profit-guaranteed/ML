What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So on that note, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.

If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Tesla is:

Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) รท (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)

0.11 = US$8.9b รท (US$107b - US$29b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).

Therefore, Tesla has an ROCE of 11%. In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Auto industry average of 8.9% it's much better.
