There’s an interloper in the house. Tech has been the market’s driving theme over the past year, but one stock piling on the gains has been a bit of an anomaly. Boosted by its positioning in the weight loss drugs space, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) has been giving the big tech brigade a run for its money. After delivering exceptional returns in 2023, the pharma giant has continued to do so this year (up by 32%), with only Nvidia bettering its year-to-date performance amongst S&P 500 names.

So, is it time to let the outsider in and turn the Magnificent 7 into the Magnificent 8? That should be considered, says Goldman Sachs analyst Chris Shibutani.

“While LLY has traditionally not been discussed as part of the Mag-7 club given it’s not a Tech stock, we believe it is now well-established in the narrative of companies contributing to a major technological development that could have large societal ramifications,” the analyst explained.

But perhaps rather than becoming the Magnificent 8, the Magnificent 7 should retain the same number of components, with LLY simply taking the place of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Based on recent actions, it’s clear why.

“We note that recent price action between LLY and TSLA, for example, has been exhibiting a clear rotational preference for LLY as the increasingly favored name between these two mega-cap compounders,” Shibutani said. “It may not be surprising to see this rotation continue, in our view, as mutual-funds continue to right-size their LLY positions.”

Having only recently (November) received the regulatory go ahead for Zepbound in chronic weight management, LLY is “entering a powerful new product cycle,” while Tesla right now is “between two major growth waves.”

LLY also “screens better” than other mega-cap tech names such as Tesla on several metrics, including valuation and growth, and catalysts. For instance, Tesla is not anticipated to start shipping its next-gen vehicle until the second half of 2025. Meanwhile, LLY is undertaking numerous studies focused on obesity-related outcomes, which might broaden the TAM for GLP1 medications. The first of these, addressing sleep apnea in obese patients, is likely to have a data readout soon, with a primary completion date set for March.

Overall, LLY shares have a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating, a show of confidence by Wall Street’s analyst corps. (See Eli Lilly stock forecast)
