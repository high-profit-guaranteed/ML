While Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Cybertruck got off to a bit of an embarrassing start when its glass shattered during its unveiling in 2019, it’s gotten better since. A lot better, actually, as Tesla’s Cybertruck recently fended off an attempted car theft thanks to its window strength. That proved good enough for investors, who sent the electric vehicle stock up fractionally in Tuesday’s trading.

Tesla’s Cybertruck proved particularly resilient one night in Oakland, California, where a Cybertruck owner discovered and subsequently declared that his truck was “California-proof.” The parked Cybertruck was in “sentry mode,” a mode that incorporates the truck’s autopilot cameras for use as a security system.

Once the potential thief tried to break in—only to discover that production Cybertruck windows hold up a lot better than the exhibition demo model did—the Cybertruck recorded the break-in attempt, complete with the thief’s uncovered face.

The Cybertruck may have proved its mettle, but Tesla has also been doing well on the public relations front. First, when an order for 4,000 mini pies got canceled by Tesla, much to the bakery in question’s distress, Elon Musk himself stepped in and made good on the order. That was certainly a face-saver, and it got better from there.

A Tesla user offered up some suggestions for improving the Supercharger network of charging stations for Tesla vehicles. After being read over by the Vice President of Investor Relations, the list was passed on to the Supercharger team to see what could be made of said suggestions.
