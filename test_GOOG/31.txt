TikTok confirmed testing the ability for users to upload 60-minute videos. This feature is currently available to select users in specific markets, and there are no immediate plans for a broader rollout.

Initially recognized for 15-second videos at launch, TikTok has gradually increased its video length limits, adapting to the demand for longer formats such as cooking demonstrations, beauty tutorials, and educational content, TechCrunch reports.

This extension offers creators more versatility in their content, challenging platforms like Alphabet Inc GOOG GOOGL YouTube by encouraging creators to post longer videos on TikTok.

Moreover, this could pave the way for uploading full TV show episodes directly rather than in segments.

Networks might leverage this extended format to debut show episodes on TikTok, similar to strategies employed on YouTube.

TikTok also enhances the user experience for longer videos by testing features like horizontal full-screen viewing and video-scrubbing thumbnails.

Recently, Amazon.com, Inc's AMZN Twitch launched a short-form video platform, Discovery Feed, that lets users browse through short clips extracted from longer videos.

TikTok is actively working to maintain its presence in the U.S. after President Joe Biden signed legislation that gives TikTok parent ByteDance nine months, with an option to extend for another 90 days, to either divest the app or face a nationwide ban.

Reports also indicated that Microsoft Corp MSFT LinkedIn is testing TikTok-style short-form video feeds focusing on career content.

Reportedly, Uber Technologies, Inc UBER Uber Eats plans to launch a TikTok-style short-form video feature to improve food discovery.
