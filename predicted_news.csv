"Tue, 02 Apr 2024 13:07:16 GMT"," Tesla shares fell on Tuesday after the company reported a drop in vehicle deliveries in the first quarter, the first annual decline since 2020, when the global pandemic disrupted production. Here are the key numbers: Vehicle production declined around 1.7% from a year earlier and 12.5% sequentially for Tesla, not nearly as steeply as the 8.5% annual drop in deliveries. Tesla doesn't break out sales by model but reported it produced 412,376 Model 3/Y cars and delivered 369,783. It produced 20,995 of its other models and delivered 17,027. In the same period last year, the electric automaker reported 422,875 deliveries and production of 440,808 vehicles. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Tesla reported 484,507 deliveries and production of 494,989 vehicles. Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla but are not precisely defined in the company's shareholder communications.  Tesla's deliveries for the quarter fell far below even the most bearish of analysts' expectations. According to a mean of 11 estimates compiled by FactSet, analysts were expecting deliveries of around 457,000 for the period ended March 31. Estimates ranged from a high of 511,000 deliveries to a low of 414,000 for the first quarter, with estimates updated in March ranging from 414,000 to 469,000 deliveries. Independent auto industry researcher Troy Teslike, whose work is closely followed by Tesla fans, had expected deliveries to come in around 409,000. Tesla's head of investor relations, Martin Viecha, sent around a company-compiled consensus based on 30 analysts' estimates over the weekend to select investors. The consensus, which was viewed by CNBC, said analysts were expecting a mean of 443,027 deliveries and a median of 431,125 deliveries for the quarter. Tesla faced numerous challenges in the first quarter. Houthi militia attacks on shippers in the Red Sea disrupted Tesla's component supply and temporarily suspended production at its German factory outside of Berlin in January. In March, environmental activists set fire to infrastructure near that same factory, depriving Tesla of sufficient operation power and again causing a pause in production. Tesla said in a statement that ""decline in volumes was partially due to the early phase of the production ramp of the updated Model 3 at our Fremont [California] factory and factory shutdowns."" In China, Tesla faced an onslaught of competition from domestic EV makers, including BYD and newcomers such as the phone maker Xiaomi. After sluggish sales numbers for its China-made cars in January and February, Tesla reduced production of its Model 3 and Model Y at its Shanghai plant and slashed workers' schedules to five days a week from 6½ days. In the U.S., reviews were mixed for Tesla's newest model — an angular pickup dubbed the Cybertruck — which the EV maker only began to sell in small numbers in December last year. A series of discounts and incentives appeared to be less effective in driving sales volume than in the past for Tesla. During the final days of the first quarter, Tesla CEO Elon Musk mandated that all sales and service staff install and demo the newest version of the company's premium driver assistance system for customers in North America before handing over their cars. The system is marketed as Full Self-Driving but doesn't make Tesla cars autonomous. They require a human at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time. Prospective Tesla customers in the U.S. comprised a shrinking group in the first quarter of 2024, according to a report by Reuters citing survey data from Caliber. The report attributed the drop in part to Musk's persona. Musk has continued to bet that Tesla customers and shareholders will stick with the brand and company regardless of his politics and incendiary rhetoric on and beyond X, which he owns. Shares of Tesla dropped 29% in the first quarter, the biggest decline since the end of 2022 and the third-steepest quarterly plunge since the company's IPO in 2010. Tesla stock closed down about 5% on Tuesday at $166.63 per share. The company has scheduled an earnings call for April 23 to discuss quarterly results.",2

GE Aerospace , GE Vernova : General Electric completed its breakup into three publicly traded companies. Its renewable energy and power unit began trading Tuesday as GE Vernova with the stock ticker GEV. Meanwhile, the remaining company retained the GE ticker, but is now known as GE Aerospace. ""Its expensive,"" Jim Cramer said of GE Aerospace's stock. ""But then again, people want an aerospace play and you can't have Boeing."" The GE Vernova business ""turned out to be far better than I thought,"" Cramer acknowledged. Cramer's CNBC Investing Club has owned shares of GE Healthcare for nearly a year . UnitedHealth Group , Humana : Shares of health insurers including UnitedHealth and Humana fell Tuesday in response to the Biden administration's final rates for Medicare Advantage payments. ""It's an election year, and this is something that hits seniors. So, I was a little surprised that people were so bullish about what could happen,"" Cramer said. Tesla : The electric vehicle maker's first-quarter deliveries fell short of Wall Street estimates, sending shares lower by nearly 6% Tuesday. Year to date, Tesla stock is down more than 33%. ""Tesla is trading like an automobile company. It was trading like a tech company before. Now it's automobiles, and if it's automobiles it's dramatically overvalued,"" Cramer said. In autos, the CNBC Investing Club owns Ford Motor . PVH Corp. : The parent company of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger offered weak sales guidance after the close Monday amid softness in its European business. Shares tumbled more than 20% in Tuesday's session. ""The reason why everyone is so aghast at this is because we knew they came in with a strong head of steam. How did it turn so quickly? I don't know the answer,"" Cramer said. In retail and apparel, the CNBC Investing Club owns shares of TJX Companies. Paychex : Shares were modestly higher Tuesday, shaking off earlier declines, as investors digested the human resources and payroll services provider's quarterly report. """"It was a miss, so let's be very clear: It's not necessarily a buy. It was a miss on the revenue side,"" Cramer said. ""That was small and medium size business not doing as well. Interesting.""",0

We deployed 4,053 MWh of energy storage products in Q1, the highest quarterly deployment yet.  Decline in volumes was partially due to the early phase of the production ramp of the updated Model 3 at our Fremont factory and factory shutdowns resulting from shipping diversions caused by the Red Sea conflict and an arson attack at Gigafactory Berlin.  Tesla will post its financial results for the first quarter of 2024 after market close on Tuesday, April 23, 2024.

"Tue, 02 Apr 2024 13:43:11 GMT"," Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives reiterated an Outperform rating and $300.00 price target on Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)  The analyst comments ""Disaster 1Q; Could Be Turning Point in Story If Musk Does Not Reverse Trend. Tesla announced its 1Q deliveries this morning which negatively shocked the Street coming in at 386.8k vehicles vs. Street's expectations of ~443k with whisper expectations in the 415k range. Model 3/Y deliveries were 369.7k in the quarter as the company claims volume declines were partially due to early phases of the production ramp of the updated Model 3 and factory shutdowns from the Red Sea conflict/Berlin shutdown. Production came in at 412.4k, below the 432.6k Street estimate following the Berlin two-week shutdown following its fire pointing to continued strong inventory controls. Let's call this as it is: While we were anticipating a bad 1Q, this was an unmitigated disaster 1Q that is hard to explain away. We view this as a seminal moment in the Tesla story for Musk to either turn this around and reverse the black eye 1Q performance. Otherwise, some darker days could clearly be ahead that could disrupt the long-term Tesla narrative. While we remain bullish on the long term story given the prospects for growth and EV/FSD over the coming quarters, this was a train wreck into a brick wall quarter for Musk & Co. with our estimate that China was down at least 3% YoY. 1Q deliveries was a nightmare quarter for Tesla with Elon pressured by the Street and China demand remaining very soft coming out of the gates for 2024. While supply issues (factory planned downtimes/Berlin fire) has impacted supply, there is no denying this has been a quarter to forget for Musk and Tesla. That said, while Tesla right now is caught between ""two waves of growth"" patience is starting to wear very thin among investors. This is being exacerbated by the Musk AI outside of Tesla chatter, Board issues, Delaware Musk comp void, and now a likely move to incorporate in Texas. With this quarter and unlike other times, Street criticism is warranted as growth has been sluggish and margins showing compression with China a horror show and competition increasing from all angles. For Musk, this is a fork in the road time to get Tesla through this turbulent period otherwise troubling days could be ahead. With the ongoing debacle around margins, production and ongoing macro events, Musk will need to quickly take the reins back in to regain confidence in the eyes of the Street with a big few quarters ahead.

"Tue, 02 Apr 2024 14:11:00 GMT"," Tesla's first quarter deliveries fell way short of estimates, sending the shares down sharply on Tuesday and casting a cloud on electric-vehicle demand.  Elon Musk's EV maker produced over 433,000 vehicles during the first three months of the year, down 12% from the prior quarter and it delivered 387,000 down 20% from the prior quarter, the company reported. Analysts had expected the automaker to deliver over 400,000, according to estimates.  The latest deliveries' snapshot is another headwind for shareholders, with Tesla's stock down over 30% so far this year.  Tesla is facing competition from U.S. automakers, including Ford, GM and Mercedes, as well as EV makers from China. This as EV demand wanes in favor of good gas-powered vehicles.  earlier this month slashed prices on its Mustang Mach-E electric SUV by up to $8,100 after sales fell sharply in January. Ford also said in January it would reduce production of its F-150 Lightning pickup truck, cutting production at its Michigan Rouge Electric Vehicle Center to one shift starting April 1.  While the German luxury brand disclosed it won't meet its 2025 deadline to have EVs, including hybrids, make up 50% of all sales. Lackluster demand for electric-powered cars has delayed that goal until at least 2030, the company announced in February.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS",2
"Tue, 02 Apr 2024 13:05:12 GMT", Tesla Inc. had Wall Street analysts second-guessing their models as the first quarter came to a close. One after another reduced their estimate for vehicle deliveries.  They didn’t cut by nearly enough.,2
"Tue, 02 Apr 2024 15:19:09 GMT"," Does Tesla have the right business model for autonomous driving?  Tesla (TSLA -4.90%) is improving FSD rapidly, and users are raving about version 12 of the software, which is built from the ground up with artificial intelligence. But Tesla may have a big problem on its hands.  In this video, Travis Hoium shows how Tesla's business model may not be built well for autonomous driving as competitors scale a completely different, more disruptive model.  *Stock prices used were end-of-day prices of April 1, 2024. The video was published on April 2, 2024.",0
"Tue, 02 Apr 2024 12:30:00 GMT"," Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) investors are likely disappointed about the performance of TSLA in Q1, as it finished as the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 (SPX, SPY). Along the way, CEO Elon Musk also lost his coveted ""gold medal"" position as the world's richest person to Amazon (AMZN) Chairman Jeff Bezos. Accordingly, TSLA fell to the $160 level, as TSLA bears threatened to re-test its April 2023 lows ($150 level). With TSLA recovering above the $175 level but still struggling for buying momentum, TSLA bulls must be prepared for more downside volatility as the leading EV maker releases its first-quarter deliveries and production report this week.  I'm also disappointed with TSLA's performance, as I encouraged buyers to capitalize on TSLA's pullback in January 2024. I had expected Tesla's EV leadership to provide investors with confidence about a recovery in 2024, but the market hasn't bought into my bullish thesis. Moreover, Tesla's growth drivers from its mass-market vehicle and its Cybertruck platform might not be sufficient to rejuvenate the near-term weakness. Wall Street analysts have also downgraded Tesla's Q1 deliveries estimates as the market prepares for disappointment over its upcoming report.  With TSLA down 30% YTD, has the market reflected sufficient pessimism in its valuation?  Observant TSLA investors are likely aware Bulls would likely argue that we cannot rely on typical automotive valuation metrics to assess what TSLA should be worth. As seen above, TSLA's ""F"" valuation grade suggests it is too expensive relative to its sector peers. When compared to its auto peers' normalized EBITDA median multiple of 6.6x, TSLA's 32.4x metric doesn't seem to make much sense.  I believe the market has given Musk and his team the benefit of the doubt as it managed to deliver record growth over the past few years. However, with growth clearly slowing down, could 2024 be a year where Tesla delivers a YoY decline in its deliveries, as Tesla faces intense competition in domestic and global markets, particularly in China?  Revised analysts' estimates suggest Tesla could report deliveries closer to the 425K zone, slightly above last year's 423K. As a result, it could be a flat quarter as Tesla faces significant challenges in its key markets. Smartphone maker Xiaomi has also upped the ante as it looks to take on Tesla's Model 3 with its newly launched EV. However, I urge Tesla investors not to be unduly concerned with new competition just because they believe they can take on Tesla. Unless they have the scale of Tesla or BYD Company (OTCPK:BYDDF), the onus is on Tesla's competitors to prove that they can scale profitably. If they cannot scale effectively, Tesla still holds a substantial head start against these pretenders.  BYD is expected to mount a significant challenge against Tesla in China, as it looks for a 20% increase in deliveries in 2024 with 3.6M vehicles. However, it's a markedly lower growth rate compared to 2023, as even BYD needs to manage its growth normalization phase. As a result, BYD could look toward the U.S. (with Mexico as a staging base) to penetrate the U.S. market, intensifying competition for Tesla. Therefore, Tesla must ramp up its efforts to make its mass-market platform a massive success and prove its doubters wrong, regaining investor confidence.  Accordingly, Tesla is reportedly looking to overhaul its manufacturing process with a next-gen framework that could reduce operational costs by up to 50%, based on a recent study. Could that provide a breakthrough in lifting Tesla's profitability margins, which could stagnate for another year as Tesla looks to reset its growth cadence?  Wall Street analysts project Tesla to report an adjusted EBIT margin of 9.1% in 2024, slightly below last year's 9.2% metric. With revenue growth expected to fall to just under 12%, Tesla is expected to face significant challenges in justifying its ""F"" valuation grade.  Altimeter Capital CEO Bradley Gerstner highlighted his recent bullish sentiments on TSLA, arguing in favor of being ""excited about companies like Tesla, especially when others are negative about them."" Gerstner underscored his belief that Tesla has a massive lead in autonomous driving, noting the Full Self-Drive, or FSD, v12 launch as a key driver.  As a result, I believe the market will likely want more clarity over Tesla's FSD attach rates as a benchmark on adoption and potential revenue accretion from subscriptions. Despite that, I view FSD as a growth optionality that may not be sufficient to justify its expensive growth valuation. With automotive sales forming more than 90% of TSLA's sum-of-the-parts valuation, Tesla is under significant pressure to deliver a faster vehicle growth cadence for the market to lift TSLA's valuation higher from here.  TSLA buyers need to regain control over the $195 support zone to defend its uptrend bias. However, I assessed that a lower re-test of the $150 zone is looking increasingly likely. Tesla bulls could argue that a weaker deliveries report has been priced in, given TSLA's significant underperformance over the past few months.  However, I believe Tesla, Inc. buyers must be careful and not throw caution to the wind, as buyers seem to have deserted the EV leader at crucial moments over the past few weeks. Therefore, with Tesla, Inc.'s bullish bias hanging in the balance, I believe it's timely for me to turn more cautious as we await its Q1 report expected around April 19th.

The figure dipped below estimates for 458,000 despite maneuvers—like price cuts—from the EV maker to steer customers into its many stores around the world. Tesla shipped a record 485,507 new cars in the fourth quarter of 2023. Meanwhile, looming competition from China is expanding its footprint in the EV market. Shares of Tesla dipped 7% ahead of the regular session on Tuesday. • Chinese homegrown EV manufacturers such as BYD and Xiaomi —the newest entrant in the EV sector—are rolling out cheaper models and capturing a broader market share. In contrast, Tesla has fallen victim to a lack of innovation, inspiration and creativity with no new ideas on revamping its slick-looking electric cars. • Shares of Tesla have lost their mojo this year with a 30% slump in the first quarter, turning the stock into the worst performer in the S&P 500. With that, Elon Musk, who holds a 20% stake in the company, has waved goodbye to a $40 billion chunk of his wealth.

"Tue, 02 Apr 2024 20:05:13 GMT"," Tesla stock (TSLA) tumbled after the EV maker reported a significant delivery miss for the first quarter. The Q1 delivery report comes after Tesla warned in January that its vehicle volume growth rate would be ""notably lower"" than in 2023.  For Q1, Tesla reported 386,810 global deliveries, well below estimates of 449,080 as compiled by Bloomberg. Tesla produced 433,371 vehicles, which was also below estimates of 452,976.  Tesla's Q1 delivery total is a significant drop sequentially from the fourth quarter, during which it delivered 484,000 vehicles. But more concerning to investors is that the Q1 figure represents a year-over-year decline compared to Q1 last year, when Tesla delivered 423,000 vehicles. Tesla's Q1 figure is the first annual Q1 decline in deliveries since 2020.  ""While we were anticipating a bad 1Q, this was an unmitigated disaster 1Q that is hard to explain away,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note shortly after the report's release.

Production figures followed suit, dropping to 433,371 units from 440,808 in the same period. The market responded, with Tesla’s stock dropping as news of the delivery numbers circulated.  Tesla March delivery & production numbers update: Tesla Stock Dives As Q1 Deliveries Disappoint — But EV Giant Reclaims Top Spot From Chinese Rival  The company attributed the decline in volumes to several factors, including early production challenges with the updated Model 3 at its Fremont factory and disruptions from the Red Sea conflict and an arson attack at Gigafactory Berlin. Additionally, Tesla’s margins faced pressure from a pricing war with competitors, exacerbating the impact of waning EV industry demand.  CEO Elon Musk‘s directive to install and activate Full Self-Driving software on all new vehicles aims to stimulate subscription revenues and showcase technological advancements. Despite these efforts, Tesla’s stock performance reflects ongoing challenges, down 14.52% over the past year and 33% year-to-date.  Technical analysis paints a bearish picture, with Tesla’s share price below its key moving averages.  The chart above shows Tesla’s stock is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 50-day exponential moving averages. This indicates short-term bearish sentiments currently reigning over the stock.  Despite experiencing buying pressure, the stock faces significant bearish signals based on various moving averages and indicators.  The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator stands at -4.74, indicating a bearish signal, although the Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests oversold conditions at 37.74.  Additionally, the Bollinger Bands point to a bearish outlook, further reinforcing the challenging terrain for Tesla’s stock performance.  Overall, investors face a complex landscape, balancing Tesla’s strategic initiatives with technical signals. While the company seeks to address production challenges and stimulate demand, the stock’s performance reflects prevailing market sentiment.

Last month, reports also emerged that Tesla had decreased production at its factory in Shanghai, China, shifting to a five-day schedule from six and a half days previously.  Wall Street received an early indication of the direction Tuesday's production and deliveries figures could go, as data from the China Passenger Car Association reportedly showed Tesla's China-made vehicle sales to be flat year-over-year, despite sales across the industry rising 33% in China in March.  A number of Tesla's Chinese EV rivals reported monthly and quarterly results Monday, largely posting year-over-year increases in sales as a price war tightened competition there, and as some Chinese EV brands like BYD (BYDDY) and Nio (NIO) have tried to expand in other markets like Europe.

The details of the purchase are as follows:  Tesla is the second biggest holding of Ark’s flagship exchange-traded funded, the ARKK. The fund holds $$677.40 million worth of the electric-vehicle giant’s shares and these shares have a weighting of 8.93% weighting in the fund.  Meanwhile, Ark continued to offload Nvidia Corp. NVDA as ARKQ sold 1,959 shares of the AI stalwart. The sales would have fetched the firm about $1.75 million. The firm, however, stalled the selling of crypto-linked stocks Coinbase Global, Inc. COIN and Robinhood Markets, Inc. HOOD amid the sell-off in cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin BTC/USD fell about 3.75% over the past 24 hours and traded at around the $66,000 level.

The Elon Musk-led company delivered 386,810 vehicles for the first quarter, down 8.5% from the year-ago period and a steeper 20.16% decline from the fourth quarter.  The first-quarter performance marked the first year-over-year decline since the COVID-19-hit second quarter of 2020.  Tesla blamed the weak performance on the early phase of the production ramp of the updated Model 3 at the Fremont factory and factory shutdowns resulting from shipping diversions caused by the Red Sea conflict and an arson attack at Gigafactory Berlin.  Reacting to the number, Future Fund’s Gary Black said, “This will renew the narrative about TSLA's 60x 2024 P/E with negative volume, revenue and eps growth.” The fund manager also expects second quarter volumes to also fall year-over-year.  Tesla ended Tuesday’s session down 4.90% at $166.63 after falling to as low as $163.43 intraday, according to Benzinga Pro data. ARKK fell 2.97% to $47.78.

"Tue, 02 Apr 2024 08:47:00 GMT"," Despite multiple near-term headwinds, Tesla's long-term growth prospects look quite promising.  Tesla (TSLA -4.90%), once a darling of the stock market, saw its shares reach an impressive all-time high of $409.97 in November 2021. However, since then the stock has been quite turbulent and is currently trading nearly 56% below its all-time high.  The reason? Much of this drawdown can be attributed to weak electric vehicle (EV) demand amid a high-interest rate environment, a slowdown in China's EV market, and the company's declining margins due to multiple price cuts.  Despite this, there are still several factors that make Tesla an attractive long-term pick, especially since the headwinds are already priced in. Here's why shares of this electric car giant may soar in the coming years.  Tesla has been aggressively slashing prices to stimulate demand for its EVs. Being the most profitable pure-play EV company in the world in 2023,Tesla also has the financial capacity to continue with even more price cuts, albeit at the cost of significantly reduced profit margins. CEO Elon Musk explained that the majority of customers purchase vehicles based on monthly payments -- which are increasingly becoming difficult to afford in the current high-interest environment. Tesla's pricing strategy is geared at making its vehicles accessible and affordable to these customers.  On the other hand, since the majority of pure-play EV competitors do not even make profits on their electric vehicle lines, they may not be able to afford these price cuts -- which can eventually result in more customers opting for Tesla's high-quality and affordable vehicles in the coming years.  Despite price cuts, Tesla is also striving to protect its margins by controlling production costs through various measures, including engineering redesign of vehicles to reduce component costs, improving manufacturing technology, optimizing inbound logistics, and renegotiating better prices with suppliers. The company is now developing an advanced manufacturing technology for its next-generation low-cost vehicle platform, which is expected to significantly reduce production costs.  While Tesla's price cuts are not being completely offset by the falling production costs, it has still helped the company conserve cash. The company ended 2023 with free cash flow of $4.4 billion, despite posting a record level of capex spending in future projects. Hence, price cuts coupled with reduced production costs can help Tesla outpace the competition and expand its share in the EV market.  Although Tesla earned nearly 85% of its total revenue from existing automotive sales, automotive leasing, and automotive regulatory credits in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 (ending Dec. 31, 2023), there are several other growth avenues for the company.  Tesla claims that it is working on revolutionizing its manufacturing technology to build its next-generation compact vehicle platform. Besides cutting costs, the company expects the new manufacturing technology to accelerate the pace of vehicle production and play a pivotal role in achieving profitability despite price cuts.  Tesla expects to start production of the next-generation compact vehicles toward the end of 2025, first at the Gigafactory in Austin, Texas and most likely at a new factory in Mexico. The company also plans to identify a third location for a factory outside North America by the end of 2024 or early 2025. However, CEO Elon Musk noted that adhering to the timeline may be challenging, especially since the company is currently working with multiple new manufacturing technologies.  Autonomous driving is also expected to emerge as a major growth catalyst for Tesla. In the fourth quarter, the company released Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta V12 to employees and select customers. Compared to previous FSD versions that hard-coded much of the driving behavior based on object perception, FSD beta V12 is an end-to-end AI system involved in object perception, path planning, and influencing vehicle controls such as steering wheel, pedals, and indicators based on stimuli. With Tesla keen on rolling out this FSD technology to over 400,000 vehicles in North America, the company will have access to a large amount of real-world data to further train and refine the system. Tesla has also developed the Dojo supercomputer to efficiently and effectively train AI models.  If true autonomous driving becomes a reality, robotaxis should emerge as a major revenue source for Tesla. The company has also built proprietary AI chips for inference (running the car's AI models in a real-time environment). Tesla expects these AI chips to not only provide compute power for autonomous driving of robotaxis, but also provide compute power to perform generalized AI tasks in its spare time.  Tesla has failed to meet consensus revenue and earnings estimates in three out of four quarters of fiscal 2023. Not surprisingly, the company's stock has taken a beating, and is now trading at 5.9 times trailing twelve-month sales, far lower than its three-year average PS (price-to-sales) multiple of 10.4 and five-year average PS multiple of 10. This could present an attractive entry point for long-term investors who are ready to ignore short-term share fluctuations.  In essence, considering Tesla's focus on long-term growth over near-term profitability, significant investments in new technologies and markets, and lower-than-historical valuation, it makes sense to pick up a small stake in this stock.",2
"Tue, 02 Apr 2024 20:32:27 GMT"," Tesla (TSLA) reported weaker-than-expected first quarter deliveries and production figures, triggering a selloff in the company's stock. Barclays Senior Autos Analyst Dan Levy joins Yahoo Finance Live to analyze the factors contributing to this decline.  Levy highlights slowing demand in the China and US markets, as well as production units that may have been ""left in transit."" This situation could potentially lead to an inventory buildup, necessitating ""further price cuts ahead to clear that excess inventory.""  From a fundamental standpoint, Levy says, ""there are a couple of challenges that need to be addressed"" before Tesla's stock can experience a turnaround. He highlights volume concerns, which have resulted in flat growth, and notes that an inventory buildup could lead to weaker profit margins for the company.

Editor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith  JOSH LIPTON: Tesla shares under pressure after reporting a significant delivery miss for the first quarter. 387,000, that was versus an expectation of 449,000. The EV maker noting production setbacks as a reason for the decline in volumes.  Dan Levy Barclays, Senior Autos Analyst joining us now for more. Dan, it is good to see you. So, Q1 deliveries much softer than expected, Dan. What drove this miss?  DAN LEVY: Hi, Josh and Julie. Thank you so much for having me. Look, I think there's a couple of things that you saw playing out in the quarter. I think there's weak demand that's likely playing out across a variety of regions.  We're still waiting to get the final data. But some of the China data we saw late in the quarter was quite weak. And we know that in the US, there's been some softness as well. So I think we're going to find out the share by region. But that was quite soft.  The other thing that we likely saw was that while production was Well ahead of deliveries. And there may have very well been some units that were left in transit. This likely implies that there's going to be some further build of inventory.  And this is maybe a bit of a challenge going forward as this now implies potentially further price downs ahead to clear this excess inventory. They likely built something like 45,000 to 50,000 units of inventory. It adds on top of the call it 90 to 100,000 units they already had. So extra inventory likely means that there's going to be some negative pricing ahead.  JULIE HYMAN: Dan, does that also presume that maybe what you're talking about is not priced into the stock already, that there could be further cuts, that maybe what we're seeing on the delivery side is only the first of perhaps more quarters like this to come?  DAN LEVY: Yeah, I think there was a couple of challenges that still need to be addressed from a fundamental standpoint. One is the data likely implies that you're potentially going to have flat volume year-over-year, which tells you that we're looking at really a year of no growth. This data point that we got implies that to get any sort of growth, we really need to see a ramp of deliveries in the back half of the year.  As it was, it was already a steep ramp with volume well in the range of 500,000 units plus per quarter. So one issue that needs to be addressed is the volume side. The other side is around margins.  I think there was a view that actually Tesla had been maintaining for a bit more discipline on price preferring in more recently to trade away some volume for price. But I think what we're seeing is that with this inventory build, it potentially implies further price downs ahead. And this potentially implies that you're going to have some weakness coming on margins really testing the trough that we saw in the third quarter. So there are going to likely be some negative EPS revisions coming.",2

"Tue, 02 Apr 2024 15:54:48 GMT"," Tesla Inc’s TSLA weak first-quarter production and delivery numbers have left even the most bullish Tesla analysts shaking their heads.  Fork In The Road: Tesla posted its first year-over-year decline in deliveries since 2020 on Tuesday, which sparked a selloff in shares. The EV maker said the decline in volumes was partially due to the production ramp of the updated Model 3, as well as factory shutdowns resulting from the Red Sea conflict and an arson attack at its German gigafactory.  In a new note to clients, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives called Tesla’s first-quarter deliveries print an “unmitigated disaster” that’s “hard to explain.”  “We view this as a seminal moment in the Tesla story for Musk to either turn this around and reverse the black eye 1Q performance. Otherwise, some darker days could clearly be ahead that could disrupt the long-term Tesla narrative,” Ives said in the note.  “While we remain bullish on the long term story given the prospects for growth and EV/FSD over the coming quarters, this was a train wreck into a brick wall quarter for Musk & Co.”  Ives estimated that China sales were down at least 3% on a year-over-year basis as competition continues to grow in the region. The Wedbush analyst went on to say China is a “horror show” for margin compression and called the EV maker’s overall performance a “nightmare quarter.”  “With this quarter and unlike other times, Street criticism is warranted,” Ives said. “For Musk, this is a fork in the road time to get Tesla through this turbulent period otherwise troubling days could be ahead.”  Check This Out: BYD, Nio, Li and XPeng Report Deliveries Rose In March  Despite the negative commentary surrounding the first-quarter surprise, Ives remains bullish on Tesla longer term. The analyst maintained an Outperform rating on the stock and still has a 12-month price target of $300.  Deepwater Asset Management’s Gene Munster expressed similar views to Ives in an initial reaction to the delivery numbers posted on X.  Munster attributed the “ugly” numbers to a combination of high interest rates and less excitement surrounding EVs in general. The analyst now expects Street delivery estimates to come down for the remainder of the year. Current estimates are looking for 19% year-over-year growth, but he expects growth to be closer to 10%.  Although downward revisions are likely to further pressure Tesla shares, comps get easier in 2025 and 20% growth looks reasonable, according to the Deepwater analyst.  “I still believe $TSLA is on the right track and this storm will pass. EVs are a better way to move a car and autonomy is a better way to get around. Tesla is investing in that future while other car makers are slowing their investment,” Munster said.

"Tue, 02 Apr 2024 19:24:06 GMT"," Tesla (TSLA, Financial) has sparked concerns over its growth trajectory following a disappointing report on Q1 deliveries, which fell short of expectations. This has led to a significant 33% drop in TSLA shares for the year, as market participants adjust their forecasts for the company’s earnings and revenue growth in FY24. • A year-over-year decline of 8.5% in Q1 deliveries, totaling 433,000 vehicles, marks TSLA's first such decline since 2020, attributed to challenges beyond the company's control. • External factors such as a forced shutdown of TSLA's Berlin factory due to a nearby fire and production halts from parts shortages caused by the Red Sea conflict significantly impacted operations. • Even before these incidents, TSLA faced sluggish sales, particularly in China, where competition is fierce. Reports indicated a significant drop in shipments from the Shanghai factory, despite aggressive price cuts and incentives. • Chinese EV makers like NIO (NIO, Financial), Li Auto (LI, Financial), and XPeng (XPEV, Financial) reported better-than-expected delivery figures for March, signaling a competitive shift as they gain market share against TSLA. • In response to lower-than-expected Q4 results and the anticipation of reduced vehicle volume growth in 2024, TSLA is focusing on its Full Self-Driving (FSD) platform to stimulate demand, including offering a 1-month free trial. • Long-term growth for TSLA hinges on the success of its FSD technology and a transition towards a software/AI-centric business model, despite the current financial strain from heavy investments in this area.  The overarching message is that TSLA's struggle with Q1 deliveries underscores the challenges the company faces in FY24, with major growth drivers like the Model 2 vehicle and FSD software revenue still on the horizon.",2

Global oil prices continued surging Tuesday amid a combination of supply and demand considerations that threaten to push Brent crude beyond $90 per barrel for the first time in six months. On the eve of the latest meeting Wednesday of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other countries, known as OPEC+, Brent for May delivery rose as high as $89.06. Oil prices have increased about 15% so far this year, reflecting several market factors. Recently, those include continuing turmoil in the Middle East, Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian refineries, and Mexico's decision to halt some crude exports as it prepares to open a new refinery. Underlying those factors: OPEC+ production cuts enacted last year. Wednesday's meeting likely won't change those reductions after the organization last month extended them to June. Some analysts say the cuts will remain in place for the remainder of the year.  SLB Buys ChampionX for $7.8 Billion To Expand Its Oilfield Services Offerings Shares of ChampionX (CHX) jumped Tuesday after SLB (SLB) agreed to buy the rival oilfield services provider in an all-stock transaction valued at about $7.8 billion. SLB announced that ChampionX investors would receive 0.735 share of SLB for every share of ChampionX they owned. That works out to be $40.59 per share, a 14.7% premium over ChampionX’s closing price Monday. It was the second major purchase by SLB in a week. Last Wednesday, it announced a $380 million deal to acquire a majority stake in Norway’s Aker Carbon Capture. SLB noted that the ChampionX transaction is expected to close by the end of this year. ChampionX shares were up nearly 8% at $38.19, their highest level in nearly five years, Tuesday afternoon. Shares of SLB fell 2.7% to $53.73.  U.S. initial public offerings are finally back after a nearly 2-year drought. In the first quarter of 2024, 30 IPOs raised a combined $7.8 billion, according to data from Renaissance Capital. While the number of deals was little changed from the same quarter in 2023, the funds raised tripled thanks to the comeback of large tech offerings like Reddit (RDDT) and Astera Labs (ALAB). Half of last quarter’s IPOs raised more than $100 million, the most of any quarter since 2021, and two offerings topped $1 billion: Finnish sporting goods maker Amer Sports (AS) and Kazakh fintech Kaspi.kz (KSPI). Renaissance sees “a clear IPO pickup through the spring and into the summer,” in part because the first quarter’s entrants have traded well since their debuts. Reddit surged nearly 50% in its first day of trading and gained 45% in its first week. The Renaissance IPO Index gained 10.1% over the quarter, just missing the S&P 500’s 10.6% return. The biggest offerings (>$100 million) averaged a 24% return over the quarter.  PVH (PVH) shares plunged after it reported tepid fourth-quarter revenue growth and issued weaker-than-expected current-quarter and full-year sales outlooks, as the luxury apparel maker cited cautious wholesale customers and challenging conditions in its European business. For the quarter ending Feb. 2, the company behind popular brands including Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger posted adjusted earnings of $3.72 per share on flat revenue of $2.49 billion. Analysts had expected earnings of $3.53 a share on sales of $2.42 billion. The New York-based apparel maker projects current-quarter revenue to decline 11% to $1.92 billion, falling short of the $2.08 billion estimate modeled by analysts. For the full year, PVH sees sales contracting between 6% and 7% to around $8.62 billion, below the $9.15 billion Street expectation. PVH shares tumbled more than 22% to $107.83 Tuesday morning, plunging the stock into negative territory (-12%) for the year.

Humana (HUM) led declines in health care stocks Tuesday morning after the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced that federal payments to Medicare Advantage plans will match the initial proposal outlined in January, effectively crimping health insurers’ profit margins amid rising medical costs. The CMS said Medicare Advantage plans will receive an average payment increase of 3.7%, or over $16 billion, from 2024 to 2025—the same percentage increase proposed in January. The payment revision, after excluding the estimated growth in patient risk scores, represents a 0.16% decline, which led health insurers to lobby for a larger increase after January's initial proposal. Shares of Humana, which had warned in January that higher-than-expected medical costs to cover Medicare Advantage patients would hurt its full-year profit, were hit hardest among health care stocks. Shares fell 13.3% to $304.56 Tuesday morning, putting it at levels not seen since the early days of the pandemic.

"Wed, 03 Apr 2024 00:58:36 GMT"," March was another tough month for Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) as the leading electric vehicle maker continued to face challenges related to production and demand.  There weren't any major reasons for the sell-off, but analyst sentiment on the stock seemed to sour heading into its first-quarter earnings report later this month, and the company was forced to temporarily shut down its German factory after an arson attack on the electrical grid.  According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the stock fell 13% last month. As you can see from the chart below, most of its losses came in the first half of the month.",2
"Tue, 02 Apr 2024 13:42:57 GMT"," Tesla (TSLA) shares are trading lower Tuesday after the company missed analyst expectations for first-quarter deliveries. The electric vehicle maker reported delivering 386,810 vehicles during the quarter, falling short of around 449,000 units analysts had anticipated.  Entrepreneur, Investor, and VC Angel Larry Goldberg joins Yahoo Finance to break down Tesla's performance and how it could operate moving forward.  Goldberg outlines his hope for Tesla after the disappointing results: ""For me the quarterly results are not as important as the trends and where they're going. We're seeing the introduction of a new model... just beginning to crank up, so we don't have production from there. We see the cyber truck beginning to get under way. That's been a very promising launch, by the way. I expect that we're going to see 100,000 cyber trucks delivered this year. I think that's going to have a huge impact on performance for the year.""  For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.  Editor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith + Nicholas Jacobino  - Tesla shares plunging after first-quarter delivery numbers. They came in at 386,810, below estimates of just over 449,000. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian joins us now with an update. So a disappointment, and some people saw this coming.  - Yeah, Jared. This is a-- I'm almost shocked here looking at this number because Bloomberg had estimates consensus around 454-ish or so thereabouts. The Street had been pulling these numbers. Deutsche Bank was at 414, and they missed that.  This is also a huge sequential miss compared to Q4 and also a miss compared to last year, which was around 422, I believe-- I'm just remembering these numbers from last year. So just really, I think, well, well, well, well, well below what people thought would be reported, and I think that's why you're seeing the reaction on the share price right now.  It might even it might even go lower when the market opens at 9:30.  - Versus consensus. It's a 15% draw down, the 386,000 number there. You've had a chance to peruse some of the other delivery reportings that have come in from other automakers. How does this fit into the puzzle? What is the puzzle looking at now?  - So we saw Rivian today, a slight beat there, obviously much lower in terms of volume. We're talking about less than 10% volume here of what they're doing, so it's a different market for them.  But we talk about problems in China. Is that what's going on here? Is that the issue here? Is it just that they're hitting-- the amount of people that have converted over to EVs has hit that critical point where we're not seeing much more growth?  We've seen demand wane a bit. We've seen the Tesla image attached to Elon Musk-- the caliber numbers that came out. Reuters reported on this. Musk has had a noticeable effect on the Tesla brand equity, right? So a lot happening here, I think, under the surface of these numbers, and it's not looking too good right now.  - Yeah. Just to put some context on this, as you were talking about the comparisons between Rivian and Tesla, well, Rivian even for their total production figure, 13,980 vehicles produced during Q1. Tesla, for their other models alone-- so we're talking about the S. We're talking about the X. That brought in 17,000 deliveries.  But again, here, year over year, that is a decline. We-- I went back and just took a look at those figures really quickly here. That was coming in at upwards of 440,000 vehicles produced last year. So that is a year over year--  - And Q1 last year was 422 or thereabouts, right?  - Yeah. Yeah. So that's-- I think that's a-- I don't think they've had a sequential decline in deliveries in, if not forever, I can't remember the last time they had that.  - I'm looking at a heat map here on the Wi-Fi interactive. This is our electrical vehicles and components intraday map. This shows premarket quotes in the little red boxes below, and it's sorted by performance.  So Li Auto is actually in the green in the upper left, but check out in the bottom right. We have Go EV down 30%. We have MVST, that's Microvast Holdings-- that's battery technology. So charging and charging technology, battery technology just getting whacked. MVST down 25%. And those compared to Tesla down 6%, 7%. Nikola down 6%, 7%  So there's-- I think there's a lot of forward looking in this. Just to underscore where you were coming from before that the industry overall may be in for a more serious slump.  - Well, EVs versus-- talking about the rest of the industry. We talked a lot of specifically CEOs at the Auto Show-- at New York Auto Show-- and they say US auto sales are actually climbing this year from-- compared to last year. So it's the EV drawdown that we're seeing here.  I want to note a couple of things in that Tesla report. Notice it said other vehicles. They usually just say this X and Model S. That's including the Cybertruck now. So the question is, why don't they give us those numbers yet? I know they say they haven't volume production, but I think there's some people would want to hear that.  - There's some politics to breaking out numbers and segments. There always is there.  - Yeah, and then producer extraordinaire and the EP of the show, Belle Cavallo, told me that this is the first annual Q1 decline since 2022- in deliveries so-- or 2020. I can't even read the thing right-- 2020.  - And that was the beginning of the pandemic? All right. Well, thank you for that report. Pras Subramanian will be all over that going into the close today.",2
"Wed, 03 Apr 2024 02:14:41 GMT"," Tesla Q1 deliveries 2024: Tesla (TSLA.O) on Tuesday posted a decline in quarterly deliveries for the first time in nearly four years and missed Wall Street estimates, a performance some described as ""ugly"" as price cuts failed to stir demand in a highly competitive market.  Shares of the Elon Musk-led company were down 5.2 per cent at $166.08 on Tuesday afternoon, losing about $30 billion in market value. The shares have fallen about 33 per cent so far this year.  After years of rapid sales growth that helped turn Tesla into the world's most valuable automaker, the company is bracing for a slowdown in 2024.   The EV maker has been slow to refresh its aging models as high interest rates have sapped consumer appetite for big-ticket items and rivals in China, the world's largest auto market, are rolling out cheaper models.   Tesla's deliveries declined by 8.5 per cent in the first quarter to 386,810 vehicles from a year ago and the company produced 433,371 vehicles during the period. Wall Street had expected Tesla to deliver 454,200 vehicles, according to the average projection of 18 analysts polled by Visible Alpha.  The last time the automaker posted a sales fall was in the second quarter of 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic forced Tesla to shut down production. Tesla attributed the drop in volumes partly to efforts to prepare its Fremont, California, factory to handle increased production of the updated Model 3 and to shutdowns at its Berlin plant due to the impact of the Red Sea conflict and an arson attack.  But Tesla produced 46,000 more vehicles than it sold in the first quarter, signaling softer demand, analysts said.  The vehicle inventory ""confirms that beyond the known production bottleneck, there may also be a serious demand issue,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner wrote in a note.  Tesla has faced intense competition in China from local players including market leader BYD (002594.SZ) - which overtook the US company as the world's largest EV maker in the fourth quarter - and new entrant Xiaomi (1810.HK).  The market value of Xiaomi, a smartphone and appliance maker, jumped by as much as $4 billion on Tuesday with the release of its sporty debut car, an EV priced lower than Tesla's Model 3.  Tesla managed to steer ahead of BYD, which sold about 300,000 battery-electric vehicles (BEV) in the quarter. Still, the Chinese carmaker backed by Warren Buffett posted a 13 per cent increase in BEV sales globally in the first quarter from a year earlier. Hyundai Motor (005380.KS) said sales of its Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 electric vehicles jumped by nearly 80 per cent to 10,468 units in the United States in the first quarter.  Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, called the quarter ""ugly"" for Tesla, blaming high interest rates and cooling excitement around EVs. He remained upbeat, however, on the company's long-term prospects.  CEO Musk's persona, his tilt to right-wing politics and his polarizing public statements are also turning away some potential Tesla customers in the United States, according to surveys and experts.  Tesla separately faces a host of its own image problems, including lawsuits and investigations involving its Autopilot driver-assistance system and allegations, first reported by Reuters, that it rigged the in-dash driving-range estimates in its cars. Reuters reported in December that the automaker blamed drivers for chronic failures of suspension and steering parts it long knew were defective.  Tesla called the report on suspension problems ""wildly misleading"" and has blamed drivers for not watching the road when their cars crash on Autopilot. The automaker has said it is not aware that any ongoing investigation has found wrongdoing.  Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives called Tuesday's results ""an unmitigated disaster"" and termed them a seminal moment for Tesla. ""This was a train wreck into a brick wall quarter for Musk & Co,"" he wrote in a research note.  In January, Tesla also warned of ""notably lower"" sales growth this year as it focuses on the production of its next-generation electric vehicle. Tesla delivered 369,783 Model 3 and Model Ys, and about 17,000 vehicles of other models, including Model S sedan, Cybertruck and Model X premium SUV.  Meanwhile, California-based EV maker Rivian (RIVN.O) reported stronger-than-expected quarterly vehicle deliveries, but the stock was pulled down by Tesla's results and worries about demand, according to analysts.",2

"Tue, 02 Apr 2024 13:13:00 GMT"," Tesla has released its Q1 2024 delivery and production numbers: confirming the suspicion that it is not growing anymore.  It’s even worse than most people anticipated.  As we have been reporting in the last few weeks, the expectations for Tesla’s Q1 2024 deliveries are all over the place.  Last month, the Wall Street consensus was around 470,000 deliveries, but it has been consistently revised down over the last few weeks as many of them now expect quite a disastrous quarter compared to the previous one.  As of today, the consensus is 431,000 deliveries.  In comparison, Tesla had record deliveries of 484,507 vehicles last quarter for a 20% year-over-year growth rate, and it delivered 422,875 in Q1 2023.  431,000 deliveries would still be a small growth year-over-ear, but it would be a massive quarter-to-quarter drop.  Today, Tesla released its official Q1 2024 delivery and production results – confirming 386,810 deliveries for the first quarter of the year.  Tesla listed several excuses for the big delivery miss:  Tesla’s stock dropped by as much as 7% in pre-market trading following the release.  This is next-level bad. Even the most pessimistic analysts didn’t come close to predicting this level of deliveries.  All these excuses that Tesla is listing are good excuses, but they are good for the lower production levels. They don’t explain the ~50,000-vehicle discrepancy between production and deliveries. That’s a demand problem. As clear as it gets.  I think this should be a wake-up call. This is Tesla going back about two years in terms of demand.",2
"Tue, 02 Apr 2024 14:22:36 GMT"," Good Morning Traders! In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.  Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.  We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis:  SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY The SPY is currently trading around the level of 520.67. For those looking on the bullish side, a move above this to 521.85 would be the first target. Holding above 521.85 could encourage further buying, aiming for the next support level at 523.76. If this level remains intact during the trading day, we could anticipate an upward movement towards 525.26, setting the stage for reaching our highest bullish target at 526.31.  Conversely, should the SPY fail to maintain the support at 520.67, the bearish scenario comes into play. The first point of interest for the bears would be at 519.71, testing the market's resolve. A breach below this could see a move towards 518.76. Should selling pressure intensify, the next significant support at 518.04 will be crucial. In a scenario of heightened bearish momentum, our lowest target for the day stands at 517.39.  Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 QQQ The QQQ ETF, also known as the Q's, is hovering around a pivotal level of 444.09. Bullish participants are eyeing a move above 445.09, with a successful hold potentially leading to a climb towards 446.51, which would act as a solid support. Sustained buying could then push the prices to touch 447.73, and with continued momentum, a test of 449.36 could be on the horizon. The ultimate goal for bulls today is reaching 450.98.  On the flip side, if the Q's struggle to stay above 444.09, the bears might take the reins, pushing the price down to 442.53 as an initial target. A further dip to 441.56 could be in the cards if the selling pressure persists. A critical support at 440.78 will be crucial; failing to hold this could see a descent to the day's bearish target of 440.00.  Apple Inc. AAPL Apple's stock is currently positioned at 169.73, with the bulls hoping to keep it as a base of support. The initial bullish target is set at 170.32, with a further rally potentially leading to 171.13. Should the bullish trend continue, we could see an attempt to breach the higher level at 171.79, marking the top target for the day.  Should Apple's shares not find the support at 169.73 sustainable, a downward test to 168.99 could ensue. A continuation of the sell-off might drag the price to 168.41, with a significant level at 168.00 potentially coming into play. If this level gives way under selling pressure, the bearish aim for the day would be set at 167.59.  Microsoft Corp. MSFT Microsoft is trading around the 423.81 mark. For a bullish outlook, holding above this level is crucial, with the next target at 425.16, which needs to be maintained as support. A firm hold above this level could propel the price towards 426.00, with the ultimate bullish target for the day being 427.36.  In the event Microsoft cannot sustain the 423.81 support, the bears might look to push the price down to 422.84. A breakdown below this could see further probing to 421.62, and with continued pressure, a move towards 419.17 might be observed. The lowest bearish target for the day is set at 417.25.  NVIDIA Corporation NVDA NVIDIA's current level of interest is 898.13. Bulls are aiming for an upward push to 903.25, with a strong hold at this level setting the stage for a rally towards 907.51. Persistent buying could lead to a notable ascent to 913.30, with the day's high target being 917.98.  Should NVIDIA fail to maintain the support at 898.13, the bears could look to challenge the price down to 890.55. A break below this level could pave the way to 882.97, with a weaker auction potentially leading to a test of 877.25. In a strong bearish push, the price could plummet to the day's low target at 865.62.  Alphabet Inc Class A GOOGL Alphabet, known by its ticker GOOGL, is presently trading near 153.93. Bulls are aiming for the stock to surpass 154.44, maintaining it as a base for further upward movement towards 154.95. Sustained bullish momentum could see the price reaching towards the high target of 155.59.  If Alphabet fails to hold above 153.93, bears might step in, driving the price down to 153.54 as an initial target. Further selling could lead to a test of 152.94, with a strong sell-off potentially bringing the price to the day's bearish objective at 152.27.  Meta Platforms Inc META Meta's current focal point is at 488.81. For the bulls, holding above this level is essential, with an eye on moving higher to 492.33. A strong bullish market could elevate the price to 495.54, with the day's top target at 498.03.  Conversely, if Meta cannot find support at 488.81, the price might be directed downwards to 485.96. Continued bearish pressure could see a further decline to 483.11, with a break below this level possibly leading to the day's lowest bearish target at 480.96.  Tesla Inc. TSLA Tesla's trading is centered around the key level of 172.61. Bulls are looking to drive the price up to 176.34, with continued buying potentially leading to a rally up to 179.79. A bullish market condition could see Tesla testing higher levels at 182.53, with the day's high target set at 184.10.  If Tesla cannot maintain the 172.61 level as support, a move lower to 169.70 could be expected. Further selling might bring 166.89 into focus, with a significant breakdown leading to the day's bearish target at 164.87.  Final Word: Today's trading session starts quietly in terms of premarket data. Following the New York open, attention will turn to the release of the JOLTS Job Openings for February at 10 AM, alongside other key economic indicators. The market will also be keenly listening to speeches from several voting Fed members throughout the day. Given these events, we might witness considerable volatility, particularly around the JOLTS Job Openings release and during Fed speeches. Good luck today and trade safely!

And if you could put the-- let's put the heat maps on there and see what the sector action is looking like today.  Energy in the forefront. It was the leader pre-market. Also, utilities and staples in the green. So that's a little bit of a defensive setup there. Consumer discretionary, health care, and tech are the big underperformers. Down about 1%.

JARED BLIKRE: These are cars-- these are cars--  BRAD SMITH: This is the auto dealers. Great stuff.  JARED BLIKRE: Let me do this. I'm going to go back to our EVs and-- sorry for showing my back on TV. That is a no-no. But here we go. Tesla down about 6% as we illustrate how it is to work with props here.  BRAD SMITH: You know, sometimes they have a mind of their own. But for right now, it's just going to stay in place. Take a look here at Tesla. That is, of course, the disappointing delivery figure.

"Tue, 02 Apr 2024 14:53:00 GMT"," Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA, ETR:TL0) shares fell almost 6% in early trading on Tuesday after the firm missed expectations and reported lower first-quarter sales for the first time in four years.  Some 386,800 cars were delivered over the three months to March, Elon Musk’s electric vehicle giant reported, down more than 8% on the same period a year ago.  Factory shutdowns on the back of Red Sea shipping diversions and an arson attack on its Berlin Gigafactorywere to blame,Tesla said.  Production was also hit “due to the early phase of the production ramp of the updated Model 3 at our Fremont factory,” the firm added.  Analysts polled by FactSet had estimated deliveries to come in at 457,000 for the quarter, with the fall marking the first year-on-year decline recorded by Tesla since 2020.  Despite the figures, Tesla regained its spot as the world’s largest EV seller against heated competition from China’s BYD, which had taken over late last year, before missing the mark with just 300,114 battery-electric model sales during the first quarter.

"Tue, 02 Apr 2024 20:32:01 GMT"," The big business news of the day is Tesla’s announcement that its deliveries were down for the first quarter of 2024. When I checked late morning, TSLA stock was down about 6 percent, or $10.40. Tesla CEO Elon Musk in February 2024 disclosed owning about 715 million shares, or 20.5 percent of the company, which means the morning’s decline sent the market value of his stake down by about $7.4 billion.  In related news, Forbes released its “Billionaires 2024” package, listing Musk as the world’s second richest person and the richest American, with net worth of $195 billion. (That calculation preceded today’s slide.) Forbes reports, “Musk is a long way from November 2021, when he became the first person ever worth $300 billion.”  Even if you take the Forbes calculations with a pile of salt, what are the implications of the decline to $195 billion from $300 billion, the idea that the richest man in America is $105 billion less rich than he was in 2021?  It’s a reminder that the biggest fortunes are often built by accepting levels of risk and volatility that many individuals find difficult to tolerate.  It’s also a reminder of the practical difficulty of taxing unrealized capital gains on an annual basis. In March 2022, when Biden floated a revised version of what I called the Biden-Wyden wealth tax, I warned of “practical issues having to do with the valuation of assets whose worth may fluctuate wildly over time.”",2
"Tue, 02 Apr 2024 20:35:59 GMT"," April 2 (Reuters) - Tesla (TSLA.O), opens new tab posted a fall in quarterly deliveries for the first time in nearly four years and missed Wall Street estimates, a performance some described as ""ugly"" as price cuts failed to stir up demand in a highly competitive market.  The Elon Musk-led company's shares fell 5.3% in early trading and were on track to lose about $30 billion in market value.  Despite the fall, which adds to a nearly 30% slide in value so far this year, Tesla's market capitalization was still well above the combined valuation of Toyota Motor (7203.T), opens new tab, Mercedes-Benz (MBGn.DE), opens new tab and Porsche (PSHG_p.DE), opens new tab.  Tesla handed over about 386,810 vehicles in the three months to March 31, down 20.2% from the prior quarter. It produced 433,371 vehicles during the period.  Wall Street on average had expected Tesla to deliver 454,200 vehicles, according to 18 analysts polled by Visible Alpha.  ""The discrepancy between deliveries and production implies ~46k in incremental inventory, which confirms that beyond the known production bottleneck, there may also be a serious demand issue,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner wrote in a note.  The electric automaker's deliveries fell 8.5% from a year ago. The last time it posted a sales fall was in the second quarter of 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the automaker to shut down production.  Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives called the results ""an unmitigated disaster ... that is hard to explain away"" and termed it as a seminal moment for Tesla.  ""This was a train wreck into a brick wall quarter for Musk & Co,"" he wrote in a research note.  The company attributed the drop in volumes to its efforts to prepare the Fremont factory in California to handle increased production of the updated Model 3 and shutdowns at its Berlin plant due to the impact of the Red Sea conflict and an arson attack.  Tesla has been facing intense competition in China from local players including market leader BYD (002594.SZ), opens new tab - which overtook the U.S. company as the largest EV maker in the fourth quarter - and new entrant Xiaomi (1810.HK), opens new tab.  However, Tesla managed to steer ahead of BYD (1211.HK), opens new tab, which sold about 300,000 battery-electric vehicles in the quarter.  Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, called the quarter ""ugly"" for Tesla, blaming high interest rates and cooling excitement around EVs. However he remained upbeat on the company's long-term prospects.  ""I still believe Tesla is on the right track and this storm will pass,"" Munster said on social media platform X.  CEO Musk's persona, his tilt to right-wing politics and his public statements are also turning away some potential Tesla customers in the United States, according to surveys and experts.  Tesla delivered 369,783 Model 3 and Model Y, and about 17,000 units of other models, including Model S sedan, Cybertruck and Model X premium SUV.  In January, Tesla also warned of ""notably lower"" sales growth this year as it focuses on the production of its next-generation electric vehicle.

"Tue, 02 Apr 2024 13:41:12 GMT"," Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has released its first quarter 2024 vehicle production and delivery report. As per the electric vehicle maker, it was able to produce over 433,000 vehicles and deliver approximately 387,000 vehicles in Q1 2024. Tesla also announced that it was able to deploy 4,053 MWh of energy storage products in the first quarter, a new record for the company.  During Q1 2024, Tesla produced a total of 433,371 vehicles, comprised of 412,376 Model 3 and Model Y and 20,995 other models. Total deliveries were at 386,810 units, comprised of 369,783 Model 3 and Model Y and 17,027 other models. Tesla’s Q1 2024 numbers are notably below Wall Street’s estimates of 431,000 vehicles.  Tesla has provided some explanation behind its first quarter vehicle production and delivery numbers, stating that the decline in its volumes was partly due to the early phase of the updated Model 3’s production ramp at the Fremont Factory and factory shutdowns at Giga Berlin. For context, Giga Berlin saw unexpected production shutdowns due to shipping diversions resulting from the Red Sea conflict, as well as an arson attack by eco-terrorists last month.  As noted by Wall Street veteran Gary Black of The Future Fund, LLC, Tesla deliveries showed an 8.5% year-over-year decline — its first since the Covid pandemic in the second quarter of 2020. Black also noted that Wall Street analysts would likely reduce their volume and earnings per share estimates for the full-year 2024 due to Tesla’s Q1 vehicle production and delivery results.  For context, Tesla produced a total of 440,808 vehicles in Q1 2023, comprised of 421,371 Model 3 and Model Y and 19,437 Model S and Model X. Tesla also delivered a total of 422,875 vehicles in the first quarter of 2023, comprised of 412,180 Model 3 and Model Y and 10,695 Model S and Model X.  Tesla stock has dropped on Tuesday’s premarket following the release of the company’s Q1 2024 vehicle production and delivery report. As of writing, TSLA stock is down 6.10% at $164.54 per share.

"Tue, 02 Apr 2024 16:46:00 GMT"," Stock markets are beginning to warm up as the summer season edges closer and Wall Street sees slight improvement across all major indexes, led by the Dow Jones following a slow yet motionless three days on the market.  On Wednesday, March 27, the S&P 500 closed off the day up 0.9%, surpassing the previous week’s record. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 1.22% and 0.51%, respectively during the same trading period.  Following the steady performance during the last trading week of March, the S&P benchmark index has managed to gain 10% since the start of 2024, while the Dow Jones is up 5.42% and the Nasdaq is already up a robust 11% since the turn of the year.  Investors on Wall Street are cautiously awaiting key inflation figures that are set to be released on Good Friday, March 29. Markets in the U.S., UK, and Europe will be closed in observance of the religious holiday.  As seasons are gradually changing, and things begin to warm up, investors are already on the hunt for their top summer stock picks, with some hoping to uncover hidden gems that they can “buy in May and go away.”  Summer Stocks That Will Likely Heat Up Your Portfolio  There is a shared sentiment regarding the old market saying “Buy in May and go away” which often refers to investors buying stocks with the expectation of muted gains throughout the summer months.  Although, this might not always be the case. Limited data and research prove the muted performance of specific stocks during the summer months, especially in sectors that typically experience higher consumer support such as airlines, amusement parks, hospitality, food and beverage brands, and a selection of technology and biotech stocks.  Nonetheless, whether you participate in “buy in May and go away” or not, careful consideration of current market volatility against the backdrop of wider macroeconomic trends should remain key indicators of overall company well-being and stock performance deliverability.  The residential solar company SunRun (NASDAQ: RUN) was part of the rally experienced during the last several trading days of March. Company stock managed to lead the sector, rising 15% in a single day, and steadily outpacing industry competitors SolarEdge (NASDAQ: SEDG) up 9% and Enphase Energy (NASDAQ: ENPH) up 8% on Wednesday, March 27.  Currently, the company engages in several important activities throughout the supply chain including design, development, sale, and ownership, along with installation services and maintenance of residential solar systems across the U.S.  Analysts believe that the company could see stronger performance in the coming years, should management decide to begin engaging in solar storage solutions, which has become a major driver of business for other leading competitors such as Fluence (NASDAQ: FLNC), Energy Vault (NYSE: NRGV), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA).  Since the turn of the year, shares have tumbled by 32%, with the average stock price falling from $19.46 in January to $13.10 by the end of March. Declining performance could be closely related to the company’s underwhelming quarterly performance which saw revenue decline by 15.20%.  However, investors are taking stock again of SunRun as share prices begin their steady ascend upwards, and as demand for residential solar systems remains high. Solar stocks have seen positive momentum on the stock market in recent weeks, as investors await inflation data and the general confidence of potential rate cuts looming ahead.  The aviation industry has come under intense scrutiny in recent months after several incidents involving commercial plane maker Boeing (NYSE: BA) following an unused door blowing out of a 737 Max in January shortly after take-off.  Boeing has since been facing multiple federal-led investigations into the company’s safety practices, including outcry from airline customers, the BBC reported. Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun has since announced his resignation, leaving many speculating over who will replace the top boss at the company in the coming months.  Despite the wider uncertainty the aviation industry could face in the coming months, Delta Airlines (NYSE: DAL) continues to reaffirm its position as being one of the top commercial airline operators, globally.  In a recent report by Brand Finance, analysts identified Delta as one of the world's most valuable airline brands, a position the company has held for roughly six years, consecutively. Total brand value has toppled more than $10.8 billion in 2024 following a 21% increase, and after jumping nearly 23% from $8.9 billion in 2023.  Over the last month, DAL shares have managed to gain 9.4% on the market, a strong performance compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite’s 2.8% change. Similarly, Zacks Transportation - The airline industry rose 1.6% during the same period, to which Delta belongs.  On the Boeing front, however, Delta recently said in a Bloomberg article that it’s expecting delays of its order of 737 Max until 2027. Back in July 2022, the company announced an order of nearly 100 Boeing Max 10 jets worth more than $13.5 million. Originally the company was expected to receive delivery as early as 2025, however, this has since been pushed back until a later stage.  Nonetheless, Delta remains in a strong position, with shares climbing nearly 17% year-to-date, and the company reporting a steady 5% increase in revenue for its recently reported quarter. Delta holds an outstanding externally audited track record, something which has helped it maintain the top spot as one of the most reliable commercial airline operators globally.  Current economic conditions have left many investors to navigate a turbulent market as high interest rates and inflationary pressure against the backdrop of wider macroeconomic downturns have created an environment of continuous uncertainty.  However, for global payments technology company Visa (NYSE: V) business continues to remain buoyant despite the wider market volatility and consumers pulling back discretionary spending as prices remain historically elevated.  It’s hard to deny that Visa has continued to march ahead, reporting better-than-expected fiscal 2023 year-end financial results, and recently reporting a solid start to 2024, with revenue already up 9% quarter over quarter.  For the 12 months ending September 30, 2023, Visa reported a strong return in their overall payments volume, booking more than $12.3 trillion in total payments, a steady increase from $11.6 trillion in 2023 and $10.4 trillion in 2022.  Additionally, the company reported more than 212.6 billion transactions processed via its network in 2023, an increase of roughly 10% compared to the year before. Another highlight from its 2023 fiscal financial reports is that the company booked $32.7 billion in annual revenues, which was 11% up from the year before.  Based on quarterly performance, 2024 is looking to deliver similar performance with payments volume up 8% and processed transactions remaining steady with an increase of 9% for Q1. Financials for the first quarter are looking positive, with total net income of $4.9 billion up 17%, and non-GAAP earnings per share climbing to $2.41, boasting an 11% improvement.  On the stock market, shares have endured some rocky turf, although year-to-date performance sees stocks climbing 7.78%, nearly half of Mastercard's (NYSE: MA) 13.29% YTD performance.  Although Visa has been reconfiguring its business strategy over recent years, looking to acquire tech and financial startups as a way to innovate its customer and payment experience, the upcoming summer season could help boost its bottom line performance again, especially on the back of higher consumer spending and increased transaction volumes.  American solar panel manufacturer First Solar (NASDAQ: FSLR) is looking hot right now following their better-than-expected fourth-quarter results. The company reported quarterly sales of $1.2 billion, an improvement of $0.4 billion compared to the previous quarter.  First Solar says that the strong increase in sales was primarily driven by better module sales during the fourth quarter, giving their total net sales for the full year a tremendous boost. The company closed off the year with $3.3 billion in sales compared to $2.6 billion in the previous year.  For 2024, corporate management expects earnings per share (EPS) to land in a range between $13 and $14, with total net annual sales between $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion. First Solar is setting its eyes on the prize and is rapidly increasing its production output, committing more than $1.1 billion for a new manufacturing plant.  The new manufacturing plant will help the company increase its footprint within the American market, which is expected to produce over 10 gigawatts of renewable energy annually in the U.S. by 2025.  First Solar has big plans, and this includes being one of the biggest solar manufacturers in the U.S. and the western hemisphere in the coming years, with a target date as early as next year.  The company has seen its stocks dip across the market, with year-to-date performance down 2.71%. Fortunately, FSLR had managed to regain its footing throughout March with stocks bouncing back nearly 13%. The recent ups and downs in the stock are likely due to the high-interest environment under which consumers and investors have started backpedaling on their investment in solar units.  Despite the slow demand, FSLR is expected to benefit from a hefty tax credit in the coming quarter, with credits totaling more than $1.0 billion, which could help them fund their expansion as they plan to become the biggest name in solar energy within the decade.  While markets remain buoyant, investors should begin factoring in the changing landscape that is expected in the coming months. The possibility of the long-awaited rate cuts could help bolster performance, although there’s still not enough data to support this idea.  Nonetheless, the coming months could bring new challenges for investors, however, it’s important to consider how long-term strategies could minimize potential short-term risks while maintaining a positive performance level.  Whether you “buy in May and go away” or not, it’s important to factor in the changing landscape that is rapidly evolving and causing additional turbulence. Perhaps this season brings new insight that can help investors bolster their position on the market, but as with anything, only time will tell.",1
"Tue, 02 Apr 2024 13:17:55 GMT"," Tesla TSLA on Tuesday posted a decline in quarterly deliveries for the first time in nearly four years and missed Wall Street estimates, a performance some described as ""ugly"" as price cuts failed to stir demand in a highly competitive market.  Shares of the Elon Musk-led company were down 5.2% at $166.08 on Tuesday afternoon, losing about $30 billion in market value. The shares have fallen about 33% so far this year.  After years of rapid sales growth that helped turn Tesla into the world's most valuable automaker, the company is bracing for a slowdown in 2024.  The EV maker has been slow to refresh its aging models as high interest rates have sapped consumer appetite for big-ticket items and rivals in China, the world's largest auto market, are rolling out cheaper models.  Tesla's deliveries declined by 8.5% in the first quarter to 386,810 vehicles from a year ago and the company produced 433,371 vehicles during the period. Wall Street had expected Tesla to deliver 454,200 vehicles, according to the average projection of 18 analysts polled by Visible Alpha.  The last time the automaker posted a sales fall was in the second quarter of 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic forced Tesla to shut down production.  Tesla attributed the drop in volumes partly to efforts to prepare its Fremont, California, factory to handle increased production of the updated Model 3 and to shutdowns at its Berlin plant due to the impact of the Red Sea conflict and an arson attack.  But Tesla produced 46,000 more vehicles than it sold in the first quarter, signaling softer demand, analysts said.  The vehicle inventory ""confirms that beyond the known production bottleneck, there may also be a serious demand issue,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner wrote in a note.  Tesla has faced intense competition in China from local players including market leader BYD 002594 - which overtook the U.S. company as the world's largest EV maker in the fourth quarter - and new entrant Xiaomi 1810.  The market value of Xiaomi, a smartphone and appliance maker, jumped by as much as $4 billion on Tuesday with the release of its sporty debut car, an EV priced lower than Tesla's Model 3.  Tesla managed to steer ahead of BYD, which sold about 300,000 battery-electric vehicles (BEV) in the quarter.  Still, the Chinese carmaker backed by Warren Buffett posted a 13% increase in BEV sales globally in the first quarter from a year earlier. Hyundai Motor 005380 said sales of its Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 electric vehicles jumped by nearly 80% to 10,468 units in the United States in the first quarter.  Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, called the quarter ""ugly"" for Tesla, blaming high interest rates and cooling excitement around EVs. He remained upbeat, however, on the company's long-term prospects.  CEO Musk's persona, his tilt to right-wing politics and his polarizing public statements are also turning away some potential Tesla customers in the United States, according to surveys and experts.  Tesla separately faces a host of its own image problems, including lawsuits and investigations involving its Autopilot driver-assistance system and allegations, first reported by Reuters, that it rigged the in-dash driving-range estimates in its cars. Reuters reported in December that the automaker blamed drivers for chronic failures of suspension and steering parts it long knew were defective.  Tesla called the report on suspension problems ""wildly misleading"" and has blamed drivers for not watching the road when their cars crash on Autopilot. The automaker has said it is not aware that any ongoing investigation has found wrongdoing.  Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives called Tuesday's results ""an unmitigated disaster"" and termed them a seminal moment for Tesla.  ""This was a train wreck into a brick wall quarter for Musk & Co,"" he wrote in a research note.  In January, Tesla also warned of ""notably lower"" sales growth this year as it focuses on the production of its next-generation electric vehicle.  Tesla delivered 369,783 Model 3 and Model Ys, and about 17,000 vehicles of other models, including Model S sedan, Cybertruck and Model X premium SUV.  Meanwhile, California-based EV maker Rivian RIVN reported stronger-than-expected quarterly vehicle deliveries, but the stock was pulled down by Tesla's results and worries about demand, according to analysts.",2

"Tue, 02 Apr 2024 11:57:58 GMT"," It's been more than 20 years since Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) was founded, and 15 years since it made its first electric vehicle (EV). It's been a mainstream, mass-produced brand of cars for over a decade, in fact. And yet, the evolving company is still making as many headlines now as it ever has. Maybe more.  Not all of these headlines are bullish for Tesla stock, mind you. The EV manufacturer along with its CEO seem to be on the defensive these days. That's a big reason why Tesla stock is down by more than 50% from its late-2021 peak, and still teasing a new 52-week low; this sell-off and all the drama causing it are keeping investors guessing as to what's next for the storied company.

"Tue, 02 Apr 2024 07:52:00 GMT"," Xiaomi shares gained 9% on Tuesday, the first day of trading since the smartphone maker launched its electric vehicle (EV) ahead of the Easter weekend.  Priced at 215,900 yuan (US$30,408), Xiaomi’s standard SU7 is cheaper than Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA, ETR:TL0)’s Model 3 as China’s EV market heats up.  Xiaomi had said orders for over 50,000 cars were placed less than half an hour after the SU7 was launched on Thursday night.  The firm’s online store showed wait times of more than five months for the basic SU7 on Tuesday morning, meanwhile.  Xiaomi boss Lei Jun has previously highlighted the SU7’s faster acceleration and longer range than rival Tesla, adding to pressure on Elon Musk’s firm in China.  Tesla, which led a string of price cuts to encourage demand over the past year, was overtaken as the world’s largest EV firm by another Chinese frim, BYD, last year, with the Chinese market, in particular, emerging as highly competitive.

"Tue, 02 Apr 2024 10:56:50 GMT"," Electric vehicle giant Tesla Inc. TSLA is reportedly now the largest private employer in Austin, Texas. But a key question remains: how much does Tesla pay its Giga Texas employees?  Tesla’s Austin Growth Spurt: Tesla’s workforce in the Greater Austin Area ballooned to 22,777 last year, according to the company’s annual compliance report to Travis County’s economic development program. This represents a significant increase of nearly 86%, propelling Tesla past grocery chain H-E-B to become Austin’s top private employer, as reported by Bloomberg.  Compensation Breakdown: The report details Tesla’s compensation structure in Austin. Full-time employees receive an average annual compensation of at least $47,147, translating to an hourly rate of $35.75. However, the starting wage for new hires is lower, averaging $30.14 per hour.  Contract Labor: Tesla also utilizes contract labor for food and janitorial services at its Texas factory. The company mandates that contractors and subcontractors pay their workers a minimum of $15 per hour.  Wages at the Detroit Three: For comparison, full-time employees at Detroit’s “Big Three” automakers – Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis – earned an average of $18 to $32 per hour before the United Auto Workers (UAW) union strike in the second half of 2023.  Following the strike, the UAW ratified new contracts with these companies, securing raises of at least 33% that include cost-of-living adjustments and compounded wage increases over the contract’s duration. Under the new agreement, the top wage at these companies is projected to exceed $42 per hour by April 2028.  Tesla’s Texas Transformation: Construction on Tesla’s Texas factory began in 2020. Since then, the facility has become the U.S. manufacturing hub for Tesla’s best-selling Model Y SUV and the latest addition, the Cybertruck. It also produces 4680 battery cells, and Tesla cathode, and supports other related projects.  When Tesla initially acquired the site, it was a derelict mining area with deep pits, swamps, and abandoned buildings, as detailed by Tesla executive Rohan Patel in a recent post. However, the company chose the location due to its proximity to downtown Austin and the Colorado River.  Tesla’s Gigafactory now sprawls across 2,500 acres along the Colorado River, boasting over 11 million square feet of factory space. In 2021, Tesla CEO Elon Musk relocated the company’s headquarters from California to Texas, citing disagreements with California’s regulations, including pandemic-related work restrictions.  Earlier this year, Musk announced plans for a shareholder vote to change Tesla’s state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas. This decision follows the Delaware Court of Chancery Judge Kathaleen McCormick‘s ruling striking down Musk’s $56 billion pay package from 2018, deeming it an “unfathomable sum.”  Check out more of Benzinga's Future Of Mobility coverage by following this link.

"Tue, 02 Apr 2024 16:02:37 GMT"," Shares of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock dropped nearly 6% in the pre-market after the electric vehicle (EV) giant reported lighter-than-expected delivery numbers for the first quarter. Tesla manufactured 433,000 vehicles but delivered only 387,000. The delivery miss will continue to fuel speculation that Tesla will be hard-pressed to justify its premium valuation.  The company's 387,000 deliveries were far below the FactSet consensus of 457,000. But they were also below the 484,507 vehicles the company delivered in the last three quarters of 2023 and the 422, 875 deliveries it made in the first quarter of 2023.  That's not a trend that shareholders like to see. Particularly since Tesla continues to lose market share in China. On April 1, 2024, data from the China Passenger Car Association showed that Tesla sold 89,064 cars in the country in March, a 0.2% year-over-year increase.  However, overall EV sales in China were up nearly 33%. Not surprisingly, BYD was the leader in China sales, with over 300,000 vehicles sold. That was a 46% YOY increase.  The EV Market Continues to Be Under Pressure  To be fair, many of the issues weighing on Tesla and the company's stock are not unique to Tesla. The industry is facing hurdles as supply far outpaces demand. There are many reasons for that. And while Tesla may be overvalued, it's the definition of the best house in a bad neighborhood.  The company is not only delivering vehicles at scale, but it's profitable in a sector where companies such as Fisker Inc. (NYSE: FSR) and Canoo Inc. (NASDAQ: GOEV) face difficulties in trying to build a car company from the ground up in a rising interest rate environment.  However, that doesn't change the fact that Tesla now faces competition not only in China but also domestically. For starters, more consumers are turning back to hybrid vehicles, which benefits companies like Toyota Motor Corp. (NYSE: TM), whose stock is up 32% in 2024 and 70% in the last 12 months.  Second, as time goes on, Tesla's cars are beginning to look dated compared to the new features being offered. However, it remains to be seen if many of these companies can turn their visions into actual deliveries.  It may be tiring for some investors to hear, but Tesla does do more than make EVs. The company is a crucial part of the EV ecosystem and is one of the leading EV charging stocks. That underscores the reality that Tesla isn't going away. But is the stock a buy?  With this latest drop, TSLA stock is trying to hold support near its 52-week low. However, with the broad market selloff and concerns rising over the company's upcoming earnings report on April 17, the correction may not be over.  Add in the fact that short interest in the stock is up more than 6% in the last month, and It's possible that TSLA stock could drop to near its 5-year low around $112 a share. If the stock were to plunge that low, it would be trading at nearly a 32% discount to its current price and approximately 80% lower than its 52-week high.",2

"Tue, 02 Apr 2024 14:09:28 GMT"," Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) plunged in trading after announcing dismal vehicle deliveries in Q1. In the first quarter, the EV major produced 433,000 vehicles and delivered around 387,000 vehicles. This vehicle delivery number was below analysts’ expectations of vehicle deliveries of 457,000.  Furthermore, Tesla produced 412,376 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles and delivered 369,783 of them in Q1. The company produced 20,995 of its other models and delivered 17,027 vehicles in the first quarter.  The company’s volumes declined as it was in the initial stages of increasing the production of its updated Model 3 at its Fremont factory. In addition, factory shutdowns occurred due to shipping diversions as a result of the Red Sea conflict and an arson attack at its Gigafactory in Berlin.  Tesla is expected to report its first-quarter results on April 23.  Analysts remain sidelined about TSLA stock with a Hold consensus rating based on nine Buys, 19 Holds, and seven Sells. Year-to-date, TSLA has declined by more than 25%, and the average TSLA price target of $198.72 implies an upside potential of 13.4% at current levels.",2

"Tue, 02 Apr 2024 11:51:35 GMT"," Tesla Inc.‘s TSLA sales of vehicles made in China saw a modest increase in March, offering a glimmer of hope for the global numbers due on Tuesday before the market opens.  What Happened: According to data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) reported by CnEVPost, the U.S. electric vehicle giant sold 89,064 China-made electric vehicles (MIC) in March. This represents a nearly 48% increase from February’s sales of 60,365 units. However, it’s a flat performance compared to March 2023, which saw sales of 88,869 units. Tesla sold 71,447 EVs in China in January.  For the first quarter, the company delivered a total of 220,681 MIC cars. These China-made cars are sold domestically and exported to other Asian countries and Europe.  Taking into account weekly insurance registration data, analyst Gary Black of Future Fund estimates Tesla may have sold 133,700 EVs in China in total for the quarter. This would represent a 2% year-over-year decline and a steeper 22.2% drop compared to the previous quarter.  According to company-compiled consensus figures shared by Black on Monday, Tesla’s global deliveries for the quarter are expected to be around 431,000 units. Black anticipates a year-over-year decline in first-quarter sales, marking the first such drop since COVID-19 impacted sales in 2020.  In premarket trading, Tesla stock fell 0.55% to $174.25, according to Benzinga Pro data.  See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Tesla Stock",1

"Tue, 02 Apr 2024 15:10:54 GMT"," On Tuesday, Wedbush maintained its Outperform rating and a $300.00 price target on Tesla (NASDAQ: ) shares, despite the electric vehicle manufacturer's first-quarter delivery numbers falling short of market expectations. Tesla reported that it delivered 386,800 vehicles for the quarter, a significant miss compared to the anticipated 443,000 by analysts, with even more modest ""whisper"" estimates around 415,000.  The lower-than-expected figures were attributed to several factors, including the early stages of the ramp-up for the updated Model 3, as well as disruptions caused by the Red Sea conflict and a temporary shutdown of the Berlin factory.  The production for the quarter was reported at 412,400 vehicles, which also did not meet the expected 432,600, hinting at stringent inventory control despite the shortfall. The Model 3 and Model Y accounted for the majority of the deliveries, totaling 369,700 units. The company indicated that the delivery volume decline was partly due to production adjustments and shutdowns.  Wedbush described the first quarter as a ""disaster"" that could not easily be dismissed and labeled it a pivotal moment for Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk, to address and reverse the trend. The firm noted that while the long-term outlook for Tesla remains positive, based on expected growth in electric vehicles and full self-driving technology, the recent quarter's performance was akin to a ""train wreck into a brick wall.""  The analyst pointed out that the lower deliveries and a potential 3% year-over-year decline in China posed significant pressure on the company. Supply chain issues, including planned factory downtimes and the Berlin facility's fire, were acknowledged as contributing factors to the supply constraints.  Still, the firm also emphasized that investor patience is waning in the face of these challenges, exacerbated by distractions such as Musk's AI ventures outside of Tesla, board controversies, and potential corporate moves to Texas.  In summary, while the first quarter of 2024 has been described as a ""nightmare"" for Tesla, with increasing competition and margin pressures, Wedbush continues to endorse an Outperform rating on the stock. The analyst stressed the importance of the upcoming quarters for Musk to steer the company through this difficult period and restore confidence among investors.  In light of Wedbush's analysis, current InvestingPro data and tips provide a deeper understanding of Tesla's financial health and market position. Tesla holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, which is a positive sign of financial stability.  Moreover, while 16 analysts have revised their earnings downwards for the upcoming period, it's noteworthy that Tesla is still a prominent player in the Automobiles industry. This context may help investors weigh the recent delivery shortfall against the company's larger industry standing and financial practices.  InvestingPro data shows Tesla with a market capitalization of $528.71 billion, reflecting its significant presence in the market. The company's P/E ratio stands at 36.77, which, although high, may be justified by its growth potential and industry leadership. The revenue growth of 18.8% over the last twelve months as of Q1 2023 further underscores Tesla's ability to increase sales amidst challenging conditions.  Despite recent stock price volatility, with a 29.47% decline over the last three months, Tesla's strong return over the last decade indicates a track record of resilience and long-term value creation for shareholders.

"Tue, 02 Apr 2024 08:57:44 GMT"," (NASDAQ: TSLA), once a darling of the stock market, saw its shares reach an impressive all-time high of $409.97 in November 2021. However, since then the stock has been quite turbulent and is currently trading nearly 56% below its all-time high.  The reason? Much of this drawdown can be attributed to weak electric vehicle (EV) demand amid a high-interest rate environment, a slowdown in China's EV market, and the company's declining margins due to multiple price cuts.

"Tue, 02 Apr 2024 08:28:13 GMT"," Gary Black of Future Fund anticipates Tesla's first-quarter deliveries to be around 409,000 units, marking a decrease from the previous year's 423,000 units. This could signify Tesla's first year-over-year sales decline since 2020.  There are varying estimates for the first quarter, with some expecting about 457,000 units, an 8% increase from the first quarter of 2023. However, the company's own number suggests slower growth.  The potential slowdown is attributed to a combination of slowing demand and production issues, particularly with the refreshed Model 3 at Tesla's Fremont, California plant.  Tesla's shares have seen a 29% decrease year-to-date. Despite this, there is potential for a stock rally if first-quarter deliveries rise year-over-year.",2

"Tue, 02 Apr 2024 17:46:56 GMT"," When a giant falls, it can make one heck of a loud noise. Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) first-quarter delivery miss is particularly unsettling as it has implications not only for the company but for the electric-vehicle (EV) market as a whole.  On a global level, the push for car buyers to switch to EVs hasn’t been as swift or as easy as some investors had hoped it would be. In particular, China has been a sticking point for U.S.-based automakers as customers have demonstrated a preference for domestic manufacturers such as BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY).  Granted, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has warned that China-based EV manufacturers will “demolish” their American rivals if trade barriers aren’t put in place. In fact, that demolition may already be in effect, with TSLA stock in free fall and wide-eyed investors left to pick up the pieces.  Off by 5% to 6% at midday on Tuesday, Tesla stock has declined sharply from its late-2021 peak of around $400. Before anyone assumes that the shares are a screaming bargain though, it’s important to consider the reason for the sell-off.  It’s not difficult to identify the culprit. Tesla just released its vehicle production and delivery figures for the first quarter, and the market isn’t pleased with the numbers.  First, I’ll acknowledge the positive news. In Q1 2024, Tesla produced 433,371 vehicles and delivered 386,810 vehicles. Therefore, Tesla has a delivery-to-production ratio of 386,810/433,371 or around 89%, which isn’t bad at all.  That’s all of the good news that I could dig up, and it took some mental gymnastics to get there. Beyond the delivery-to-production ratio, it’s hard to find anything encouraging about Tesla’s quarterly operational report.  Unfortunately for the company and its shareholders, those 386,810 deliveries fell far short of the analysts’ consensus estimate of 449,080 deliveries. This result also represented a major plunge compared to the 484,000 vehicles that Tesla delivered in the prior quarter.  Furthermore, Tesla’s 433,371 produced vehicles didn’t match up to the consensus forecast of 452,976 units. In other words, even if Musk had prepared investors for a challenging quarter, the actual results revealed serious issues going on under the hood at Tesla.  It’s evident that Tesla and Musk understood how bad the quarterly operational results were. The automaker offered an excuse or two, blaming the “early phase of the production ramp of the updated Model 3 at our Fremont factory and factory shutdowns resulting from shipping diversions caused by the Red Sea conflict and an arson attack at Gigafactory Berlin.”  The market isn’t in the mood to tolerate excuses, however. Tesla’s status as a Magnificent Seven member was already in jeopardy, and now it looks more and more like a giant in decline.  It’s also worth mentioning that Tesla appears to be highly reliant on its relatively lower-priced vehicles. In the first quarter, the company produced 412,376 and delivered 369,783 combined Model 3 and Model Y units. In contrast, Tesla only produced 20,995 and delivered 17,027 “other models,” a category that includes the pricey Cybertruck, Model S and Model X.  It’s probably not a good sign for the EV industry generally if Tesla can’t easily sell its higher-price-tag models. If consumers lean toward more affordable models, whether out of preference or out of necessity, this could be problematic for the profit margins of automakers like Tesla.  At the end of the day, Tesla’s latest operational report signals an unfortunate directional change for a company that once seemed invincible. In fact, the first quarter marks Tesla’s first quarterly EV-delivery decline in almost four years. Thus, investors might get the impression that Musk’s strategy of price cuts isn’t working out as intended.  For one expert on Wall Street at least, this report evidently casts a dark cloud over Tesla.  “While we were anticipating a bad 1Q, this was an unmitigated disaster 1Q that is hard to explain away,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note.  The aforementioned quarterly data points seem to confirm Ives’ consternation. Looking ahead, the Wedbush analyst doesn’t sound particularly optimistic about Tesla’s ability to reverse the damage:  Calling the Q1 2024 operational report a “seminal moment” for Tesla might be overdramatic. Automakers have their good and bad quarters, and Tesla was in the doghouse in 2022 before its stock zoomed higher in 2023.  Nonetheless, to quote the classic TV show I Love Lucy, Tesla and Musk have some “splaining” to do.

"Tue, 02 Apr 2024 10:23:08 GMT"," The proverbial race among the titans of the tech industry has shown a stark contrast in the performance of two prominent companies, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), each taking divergent paths in their market fortunes in 2024 so far.  Nvidia shares have had an impressive YTD, with its price shooting up 87.6%. Tesla shares on the other hand have had a 2024 to forget so far, down 29.47% YTD, but having staged a mini rally over the last 5 days, climbing 3.83%.  Nvidia, the powerhouse known for its graphics processing units (GPUs) and ground-breaking artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, has left investors and market onlookers in awe with an astounding 87.6% surge in its stock price year-to-date. This impressive rally follows a breath-taking climb of 245% throughout 2023, highlighting the company's unassailable momentum.  This growth trajectory has firmly established Nvidia as a leader among the elite group known as the Magnificent Seven technology companies. Their competitive edge is further evidenced by the company capturing a whopping 92% share of the Data Centre GPU Market, demonstrating their strategic focus on AI, gaming, and data centre solutions—all sectors poised for sustained growth.  On the other end of the spectrum lies Tesla, the electric vehicle (EV) pioneer helmed by the enigmatic entrepreneur Elon Musk. Contrary to Nvidia's upward trajectory, Tesla's performance in the stock market has cast a shadow on its otherwise luminescent narrative. The company's shares have experienced a 29.47% decline in the same timeframe, a significant drop that has raised eyebrows considering Tesla's previously illustrious run in the market.  Throughout the first quarter, Tesla, alongside Apple Inc., faced the brunt of declines, whilst the remaining members of the Magnificent 7 added double digit gains. The relative underperformance by Tesla underscores the growing pains and operational challenges it faces within the competitive and swiftly evolving EV market. Having been thought of as a company that has many mini tech companies within its' ecosystem, Tesla is also underperforming against the Nasdaq 100, with the tech heavy index also seeing gains of more than 10% through Q1.  In stark contrast to Nvidia's relatively smooth sailing, Tesla must manoeuvre through production snags and intensifying competition to steer back into the market's good graces.  As investors continue to decipher the dynamic shifts in the tech landscape, Nvidia's ascension and Tesla's disturbance serve as reminders of the volatile nature of the industry, where innovation, strategic foresight, and market perception can make or break giants once deemed infallible.  Nvidia forges ahead with its ambitious AI pursuits and dominance in the data center arena, Tesla's journey ahead is fraught with hurdles that require strategic navigation.  Eyes will undoubtedly remain fixed on these two tech giants as they carve their trajectories in vastly different directions within the confines of the Magnificent Seven.",2

"Wed, 03 Apr 2024 00:36:00 GMT"," March was another tough month for Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) as the leading electric vehicle maker continued to face challenges related to production and demand.  There weren't any major reasons for the sell-off, but analyst sentiment on the stock seemed to sour heading into its first-quarter earnings report later this month, and the company was forced to temporarily shut down its German factory after an arson attack on the electrical grid.
