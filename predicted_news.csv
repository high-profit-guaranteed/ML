"Fri, 17 May 2024 19:52:05 GMT"," ): This company remains a top player in the cloud and search markets, and is looking to get even more efficient.  The tech industry has seen remarkable growth, particularly over the past year, attracting retail and institutional investors. Identifying promising prospects is crucial for those seeking the following significant tech investments. From semiconductor leaders shaping vehicle electronics to AI advancements enhancing user experiences, several innovative companies stand out.  Despite April’s tech sector decline, positive earnings surprises across sectors renewed optimism on Wall Street. The so-called Magnificent Seven stocks are back on investors’ radar. Each company presents unique revenue potential and innovation opportunities, signaling positive growth prospects.  The companies mentioned in this article present excellent entry points for investors aiming to tap into the expanding tech sector, which spans various subsectors. Each offers unique contributions, whether pioneering automotive electronics, providing data-driven decision-making tools or enhancing user experiences with AI. Here are three tech stocks to buy on the dip.  Due to a rollercoaster ride last 2023 and a 12% decline in April, I must admit, it can be hard to stay optimistic for Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ). However, closer scrutiny of its solid financials reveals potential. Fundamentals typically drive long-term outcomes, so Meta’s recent ROE is worth noting.  The company surged approximately 490% in under two years but recently experienced a significant market cap decline of around $200 billion after its Q1 results. Wall Street revised target prices downward, sparking debate on whether to buy or sell. Despite the setback, some investors see an opportunity to invest based on Meta’s AI-driven growth trajectory.  Q1 adjusted earnings of $4.71 per share surpassed estimates, doubling year-over-year (YOY), with revenues meeting consensus estimates at $36.5 billion, up 27% from the prior-year period. Meta Platforms anticipates Q2 revenue to range between $36.5 to $39 billion, with CAPEX increasing to $35 to $40 billion and FY2024 expenses projected at $96 to $99 billion.  Amazon (NASDAQ: ) stock experienced a significant rebound recently, shining amidst market uncertainties. Its focus on profitable growth, forward-looking strategies and strong demand for AWS cloud services are promising signs for 2024. Cost-cutting measures and expanding AI capabilities further enhance its appeal.  The e-commerce giant revealed plans to put out a $9 billion investment in Singapore for the next four years on its cloud computing plans. That also comes after Microsoft’s (NASDAQ: ) regional investment, showing more interest in Southeast Asia. The investment will aid in increasing demand for cloud services and strengthen Singapore’s position as a location for regional innovation.  Moreover, Amazon has gained from generative AI apps like ChatGPT. The company heavily invested in AI research and development, making it a core strength. AI applications such as chatbots, product recommendations, robots and inventory management enhance operations and revenue streams. Amazon’s unique generative AI platform, Amazon Bedrock, stands out, offering advanced capabilities for AWS customers.  Among all the tech companies, Alphabet (NASDAQ: , NASDAQ: ) stands out due to its excellent growth. But its appeal goes beyond this growth profile, as Alphabet provides the kind of earnings stability that’s hard to come by in the tech sector. With a target share price of $195.92, Alphabet is a top tech stock worth considering for investors.  The company remains a dominant advertising platform, with Google and YouTube attracting billions of visits monthly. Q1 2024 saw a 15% revenue increase and a 57% surge in net income, driven by Google Cloud’s growing contribution, now over 10% of total revenue. In other news, Alphabet’s talks to acquire HubSpot (NYSE: ) reportedly progress as the marketing software provider beats Q1 estimates. Bloomberg sources mention ongoing discussions, though no deal is finalized. Reuters reported Alphabet’s talks with Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ), potentially leading to its largest acquisition.

"Fri, 17 May 2024 12:47:10 GMT"," Snowflake Inc SNOW is negotiating to buy Reka AI for over $1 billion to enhance its generative AI capabilities.  Reka AI, launched in 2022 by former Alphabet Inc GOOG GOOGL Google and Meta Platforms Inc META researchers, specializes in large language models, which have applications ranging from image captioning to customer support chatbots.  Valued at approximately $300 million in a 2023 funding round that included investment from Snowflake’s venture arm, Reka AI has drawn significant interest from Snowflake, Bloomberg cites a Reuters report.  Snowflake, a cloud data management firm, launched its own large language model, Arctic, in April.  It allows customers to integrate third-party AI models like Reka’s into their Snowflake environments.  Earlier this year, Sridhar Ramaswamy, Snowflake’s CEO and a former Google veteran, was instrumental in pushing Snowflake’s AI initiatives forward.  Before becoming CEO, he served as Snowflake’s senior vice president of AI following the acquisition of Neeva, an AI-powered search engine company he led.  Snowflake’s stock has declined over 5% this year. Databricks, a leading competitor to Snowflake, recently enhanced its AI portfolio by acquiring AI startup MosaicML.  Meanwhile, analysts flagged Iceberg tables could slow Snowflake’s growth in 2024, which the company has projected at a midpoint of 22%.  This slowdown is linked to some large internet customers transitioning more storage to Iceberg’s open-source data lakehouse.  They emphasized that while Iceberg tables potentially threaten Snowflake’s business model, this threat may be overstated for now, as only about 10% of Snowflake’s revenue comes from storage, with a growing share coming from its compute engine.  They also highlighted the increased investor confidence and the acceleration of AI-related announcements under CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy’s leadership.  Investors can gain exposure to Snowflake through the Spear Alpha ETF SPRX and the TrueShares Technology, AI & Deep Learning ETF LRNZ.  Price Action: SNOW shares are trading lower by 0.35% at $164.50 premarket at the last check Friday.",2

These stocks are likely to deliver returns for more than 100 years.  People are living longer, and that means money has to stretch further. Retirement is becoming more difficult for people to attain, but there is a common path to long-term wealth. People who invest early and often have a better chance of retiring early.  Longer life expectancies also mean customers will stick around longer, buy products and services, and set an example for future generations. These longevity stocks to buy have been around for a long time and are highly likely to outlive their investors.  People will always need a reliable hub to buy products and services. Amazon (NASDAQ: ) certainly fits the bill due to its wide range of products. It’s become the most recognizable e-commerce website, offering 1 to 2-day shipping for millions of items.  While Amazon established its beginnings with its online marketplace, the company has expanded into numerous industries. Twitch attracts gamers, Whole Foods attracts grocery shoppers and the company’s streaming segment brings in people who want video content.  Those opportunities are compelling, but few of them offer the same opportunities as Amazon Web Services. Many businesses use this technology for data storage and productivity. It’s one of the many underlying businesses within Amazon’s corporate umbrella that should outlast its investors. The segment grew 17% year-over-year (YoY) in the first quarter of 2024. Overall revenue increased by 13% YoY, featuring double-digit growth rates in domestic and international markets.  Amazon stock has been on a tear. It’s up 23% year-to-date and has roughly doubled over the past five years.  Alphabet (NASDAQ: , NASDAQ: ) is another stock likely to outlive people, even if they live past 100 years. Businesses will always use advertising to get in front of potential customers. While some companies can use organic marketing strategies, advertising is still a popular way to reach people.  The company offers unmatched advertising channels via Google and YouTube. Profitable businesses can scale their advertising campaigns, generating more value for Alphabet’s shareholders. Companies that want to use organic marketing strategies will still have to study Google and how it ranks content.  Advertisers flock to Alphabet’s advertising channels because it does a great job attracting visitors. People will still search for information online and watch YouTube videos for many decades — if not centuries. Alphabet has the makings of a company that can survive for well over 100 years.  First quarter results further highlighted Alphabet’s growth. Revenue increased 15% YoY, while net income grew 57% YoY.  People will continue to use credit and debit cards for many years due to their convenience and perks. You don’t get benefits like unlimited 2% cashback if you pay with physical cash. You need a credit card to get those rewards and American Express (NYSE: ) is one of the leading credit card companies.  The firm is attracting more Millennials and Gen Z consumers. Over 60% of its new cardholders from Q1 2024 were in those groups. The quarter was a resounding success as revenue increased by 11% YoY. Net income soared by 34% YoY, pushing the company’s net profit margins higher.  American Express intends to generate annualized 9% to 11% revenue growth and EPS growth in the mid-teens beyond 2026. That long-term growth plan bodes well for a stock with only a 20 P/E ratio. Shares are up 30% year-to-date and more than doubled over the past five years.

"Fri, 17 May 2024 14:08:03 GMT"," Reddit RDDT stock rose 11% overnight after the discussion site licensed its contentto OpenAI for training large language models.  Under the deal, OpenAI will become a Reddit advertiser, and users will gain access to artificial intelligence (AI) features. The deal is similar to one signed with Alphabet GOOG, which was said to be worth $60 million.  RDDT stock opened this morning at $60.62 per share, a market capitalization of $10 billion.  The OpenAI deal may prove to be just the second or even third most important Reddit story of the week. The company hired a vice president for advertising from Google. It also brought back the reward system for users it scrapped late last year, admitting: “we messed up.”  In a blog post, Reddit said the OpenAI deal aligns with its Public Content Policy. The policy, among other things, forbids partners from spamming users and lets users delete their content.  Before the deal was announced, RDDT stock was trading at just 11% more than its first March trade, which was at $50.44 per share. The shares are now up 26% since the IPO.  The deal is another illustration of how AI companies are interacting with content players. While little money is changing hands, there are big promises of cooperation and future advertising.  Some tradersat Stocktwits were not amused. One bear called the deal a gimmick that only benefits OpenAI. The overall rating on the stock there is neutral.  JMP Securities, however, reaffirmed its “outperform” rating on the stock, with a price target of $63 per share. JMP believes that data sales can be a $500 million business for Reddit. Deutsche Bank raised its price target to $65, with a “buy” rating. At Tipranks, RDDT stock is considered a moderate buy, with only one of the 16 analysts following it rating it a sell.  RDDT Stock: What Happens Next?  Selling ads will be more important to Reddit’s future than selling data. If the OpenAI deal can help Reddit do that, it’s a big win.

"Fri, 17 May 2024 12:22:30 GMT","  • None Brin said artificial intelligence advances represent the most significant computing development in his lifetime. • None But he warned that tech companies have a responsbility to consider the impact of their advances on society, a change in tone.    Sergey Brin, the cof0under of Google, stressed the need for caution, accountability and humility within the tech industry as its innovations become ""deeply and irrevocably"" ingrained in society, a striking shift in tone among a leader of the Silicon Valley business cohort famous for its certitude of its own righteousness.  In the annual founders letter released by Google-parent company Alphabet, Brin touted the far-reaching innovations in artificial intelligence, computing power and speech recognition in recent years.  ""Every month, there are stunning new applications and transformative new techniques. In this sense, we are truly in a technology renaissance, "" Brin wrote in the letter published on Alphabet's investor relations site on Friday. Advances in artificial intelligence, he said, represent the ""most significant development in computing in my lifetime.""  But Brin said the tech industry could no longer maintain its ""wide-eyed and idealistic"" attitude about the impact of its creations.  ""There are very legitimate and pertinent issues being raised, across the globe, about the implications and impacts of these advances,"" Brin said.  ""How will they affect employment across different sectors? How can we understand what they are doing under the hood? What about measures of fairness? How might they manipulate people? Are they safe?""  Brin has seemed dismissive of ""hypothetical situations"" in the past  The comments come as the tech industry, which represent the most valuable companies in the American economy, has come under fire for a variety of issues, including the collection and misuse of people's personal information (as highlighted by Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal), the spread of misinformation, propaganda and hate speech on services like YouTube, Google and Facebook, and a growing anxiety about our dependence on smartphones.  Brin has been an important figure in the development of technologies once considered the stuff of science fiction, helping to shape the Google X labs where products like self-driving cars, face-worn computers and airborne delivery drones were born.  The 44-year old Russian-born executive has at times shown himself to be dismissive of the public's concerns regarding potential impacts of technological advances, labeling some as ""hypothetical situations.""  ""We can debate as philosophers, but the fact is that we can make cars that are far safer than human drivers,"" Brin said at a tech conference in 2014, when asked about the ethics involved in creating self-driving cars that must choose between hitting a pedestrian or a truck.  In March, the first self-driving car fatality oc cured in Arizona when an Atmos Uber vehicle struck a pedestrian at night (human-driven cars are involved in more than 35,000 traffic fatalities per year in the US).  ""There is serious thought and research going into all of these issues,"" Brin wrote in the founder's letter on Friday. ""Most notably, safety spans a wide range of concerns from the fears of sci-fi style sentience to the more near-term questions such as validating the performance of self-driving cars.""  It was the best of times,  it was the worst of times,  it was the age of wisdom,  it was the age of foolishness,  it was the epoch of belief,  it was the epoch of incredulity,  it was the season of Light,  it was the season of Darkness,  it was the spring of hope,  it was the winter of despair ...”  So begins Dickens’ “A Tale of Two Cities,” and what a great articulation it is of the transformative time we live in. We’re in an era of great inspiration and possibility, but with this opportunity comes the need for tremendous thoughtfulness and responsibility as technology is deeply and irrevocably interwoven into our societies.  The power and potential of computation to tackle important problems has never been greater. In the last few years, the cost of computation has continued to plummet. The Pentium IIs we used in the first year of Google performed about 100 million floating point operations per second. The GPUs we use today perform about 20 trillion such operations — a factor of about 200,000 difference — and our very own TPUs are now capable of 180 trillion (180,000,000,000,000) floating point operations per second.  Even these startling gains may look small if the promise of quantum computing comes to fruition. For a specialized class of problems, quantum computers can solve them exponentially faster. For instance, if we are successful with our 72 qubit prototype, it would take millions of conventional computers to be able to emulate it. A 333 qubit error-corrected quantum computer would live up to our name, offering a 10,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000x speedup.  There are several factors at play in this boom of computing. First, of course, is the steady hum of Moore’s Law, although some of the traditional measures such as transistor counts, density, and clock frequencies have slowed. The second factor is greater demand, stemming from advanced graphics in gaming and, surprisingly, from the GPU-friendly proof-of-work algorithms found in some of today’s leading cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum. However, the third and most important factor is the profound revolution in machine learning that has been building over the past decade. It is both made possible by these increasingly powerful processors and is also the major impetus for developing them further.  The new spring in artificial intelligence is the most significant development in computing in my lifetime. When we started the company, neural networks were a forgotten footnote in computer science; a remnant of the AI winter of the 1980’s. Yet today, this broad brush of technology has found an astounding number of applications. We now use it to: • None significantly improve sound and camera quality in our hardware; • None caption over a billion videos in 10 languages on YouTube; • None improve the efficiency of our data centers; • None help doctors diagnose diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy; • None create better neural networks (AutoML);  ... and much more.  Every month, there are stunning new applications and transformative new techniques. In this sense, we are truly in a technology renaissance, an exciting time where we can see applications across nearly every segment of modern society.  However, such powerful tools also bring with them new questions and responsibilities. How will they affect employment across different sectors? How can we understand what they are doing under the hood? What about measures of fairness? How might they manipulate people? Are they safe?  There is serious thought and research going into all of these issues. Most notably, safety spans a wide range of concerns from the fears of sci-fi style sentience to the more near-term questions such as validating the performance of self-driving cars. A few of our noteworthy initiatives on AI safety are as follows:  I expect machine learning technology to continue to evolve rapidly and for Alphabet to continue to be a leader — in both the technological and ethical evolution of the field.  Roughly three years ago, we restructured the company as Alphabet, with Google as a subsidiary (albeit far larger than the rest). As I write this, Google is in its 20th year of existence and continues to serve ever more people with information and technology products and services. Over one billion people now use Search, YouTube, Maps, Play, Gmail, Android, and Chrome every month.  This widespread adoption of technology creates new opportunities, but also new responsibilities as the social fabric of the world is increasingly intertwined.  Expectations about technology can differ significantly based on nationality, cultural background, and political affiliation. Therefore, Google must evolve its products with ever more care and thoughtfulness.  The purpose of Alphabet has been to allow new applications of technology to thrive with greater independence. While it is too early to declare the strategy a success, I am cautiously optimistic. Just a few months ago, the Onduo joint venture between Verily and Sanofi launched their first offering to help people with diabetes manage the disease. Waymo has begun operating fully self-driving cars on public roads and has crossed 5 million miles of testing. Sidewalk Labs has begun a large development project in Toronto. And Project Wing has performed some of the earliest drone deliveries in Australia.  There remains a high level of collaboration. Most notably, our two machine learning centers of excellence — Google Brain (an X graduate) and DeepMind — continue to bring their expertise to projects throughout Alphabet and the world. And the Nest subsidiary has now officially rejoined Google to form a more robust hardware group.  The Epoch of Belief and the Epoch of Incredulity  Technology companies have historically been wide- eyed and idealistic about the opportunities that their innovations create. And for the overwhelming part, the arc of history shows that these advances, including the Internet and mobile devices, have created opportunities and dramatically improved the quality of life for billions of people. However, there are very legitimate and pertinent issues being raised, across the globe, about the implications and impacts of these advances. This is an important discussion to have. While I am optimistic about the potential to bring technology to bear on the greatest problems in the world, we are on a path that we must tread with deep responsibility, care, and humility. That is Alphabet’s goal.

"Fri, 17 May 2024 10:00:00 GMT"," Television ""upfront"" advertiser presentations this week in New York City were hardly about TV at all.  The annual week-long affair where media executives have traditionally pre-sold TV advertising featured many familiar trappings: pop stars Alicia Keys and Billie Eilish dazzled packed auditoriums with live performances; celebrities Kevin Hart, Reese Witherspoon and Ryan Reynolds hawked their latest projects, and Super Bowl star Tom Brady joined other pro athletes on stage.  But it was ad tech and artificial intelligence that was getting all the attention.  Warner Bros Discovery WBD talked up shoppable ads on its Max streaming service. Google's GOOG YouTube introduced a new AI-powered format to place non-skippable ads on videos streamed to internet-connected TVs. Netflix NFLX advertising chief Amy Reinhard said the streamer would develop its own in-house ad technology that would give advertisers new ways to buy and gain new insights.  ""You're probably wondering why I am so giddy today,"" joked late-night host Jimmy Kimmel at Walt Disney's DIS presentation. ""It's because Disney is using proprietary meta-tagging data that leverages video intelligence to tap into the moods and emotions within the content we create. That's why I'm so proud of what we've done here.""  Streaming players also sought to win over advertisers from traditional media rivals by emphasizing their increasing reach.  Netflix's Reinhard said the company's ad-supported plan now has 40 million global monthly users, up from 5 million a year ago. In countries where Netflix offers a version of its service with advertising, it accounts for 40% of all sign-ups, she said.  Chief Content Officer Bela Bajaria touted the chart-topping popularity of shows like its period drama ""Bridgerton"" and the streaming service's expanded investment in big, live events, including a splashy deal to stream two NFL professional football games on Christmas Day.  At Amazon.com AMZN, the online superstore and cloud computing giant's biggest news was its appearance at the event. To make a memorable first impression with ad buyers at its first upfront since introducing ads on Prime Video earlier this year, the company treated some 2,500 guests to a bounty of breakfast foods that reminded some of the big-shrimp buffets of television's heyday.  Displays arrayed around Pier 36 in Manhattan showcased the breadth of Prime Video's streaming content, including one that rained dollar bills from the ceiling to promote a forthcoming reality competition from YouTube personality Mr. Beast that offers a $5 million prize.  Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios, called Amazon a ""one-stop destination"" for entertainment and said it delivers ads to more than 200 million global customers, 115 million of whom live in the U.S.  Disney CEO Bob Iger returned to the upfront stage for the first time since 1994, back when ""television used to be something you watched on television.""  While much has changed over the last three decades, he said, ""what hasn't changed is the fact that success in this industry is predicated on one thing: telling great stories.""  A day later Iger, speaking at MoffettNathanson's 2024 Media, Internet and Communications Conference in New York, told investors he had cut investment in programming for traditional television dramatically as part of Disney's strategy to maximize audiences and profit in streaming.",1
"Fri, 17 May 2024 16:45:04 GMT"," Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.  In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.  However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.  Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.  Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).  Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this company a great growth pick right now.  Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.  While the historical EPS growth rate for Alphabet is 23.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 31.8% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 29.6%.  While cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.  Right now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Alphabet is 16.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -19.1%.  While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 15.1% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 12.5%.  Beyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.  The current-year earnings estimates for Alphabet have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 12.7% over the past month.  While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Alphabet a Zacks Rank #1 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.  You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.  This combination indicates that Alphabet is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.

"Fri, 17 May 2024 21:30:00 GMT"," While it might sound like a smart idea to try and find small businesses that could become tomorrow's big winners in the stock market, investors can't ignore the companies that are hiding in plain sight.  Just look at Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG). The tech titan's shares have soared 190% just in the past five years, far outpacing the broader Nasdaq Composite Index. But I don't think it's done rewarding shareholders.  Where will Alphabet be in five years?  Most readers are familiar with Alphabet as a business that's essentially the gateway to the internet. The company owns and operates Google Search, a monopoly service that is the single most popular website on planet Earth. Its wide reach has made Alphabet the perennial leader in the digital-ad industry. According to Visible Alpha, the company commands about 40% of global-market share.  The rise of artificial intelligence (AI), primarily the massive amounts of capital being invested in this revolutionary technology, is something I'm sure spooks Alphabet shareholders. The fear is that Google Search's dominance will diminish as users change their search habits. So far, there isn't anything to worry about.  Besides the bread-and-butter search business, which has made Alphabet one of the world's most successful enterprises, there are other growth vectors that investors can't ignore. In five years, they might actually have a greater influence on Alphabet's financial performance.  The company has a huge player in the streaming wars with YouTube, which is estimated to have 2.5 billion monthly active users. According to Nielsen, it commands more TV viewing time in the U.S. than Netflix. This helps bring in even more ad revenue.  Google Cloud continues to demonstrate its phenomenal growth trajectory. Its revenue jumped 28% in the first quarter. And in 2023, this segment raked in $1.7 billion of operating profit.  As it scales up and generates more revenue, there's no reason to believe its operating margin can't approach 30%, which is where industry leader Amazon Web Services is currently at. Therefore, I'd be shocked if in 2029, more of Alphabet's bottom-line performance didn't come from the booming cloud division.  There's another potential growth engine that typically gets forgotten among all of Alphabet's other thriving segments. It's a wild card, as there is such a wide range of outcomes as to how things will ultimately play out down the road.  I'm talking about Waymo. This is undoubtedly one of the few leaders working to bring full autonomous driving to the masses.  Here's the bottom line: Waymo is a rounding error to Alphabet's overall financials at this point. However, if it can really make good on its ultimate goal of bringing full self-driving capabilities to cars everywhere, then Alphabet can become a top provider of automobile software. This could be an extremely large and high-margin business.  But it's hard to know what the probability of success is. Nonetheless, investors have a lot to still be encouraged by when looking at Alphabet as a whole.  I find it remarkable that even after shares have been a big winner in the past, they don't look expensive today. The stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 22.4. That's a below-market multiple (compared to the Nasdaq 100 Index) for one of the best businesses the world has ever seen.  According to Wall Street consensus-analyst estimates, Alphabet is projected to grow its revenue and diluted-earnings per share at 11.4% and 19.2%, respectively, over the next three years. It's easy to believe that these double-digit gains can continue even further out than that.  If we look out five years, I'll be surprised if Alphabet doesn't continue rewarding its shareholders with returns that outperform the broader market.  Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

"Sat, 18 May 2024 00:52:56 GMT"," Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary Google has been making strides in consumer hardware, generating an estimated $3 billion in gross profit last year. However, much of that success is likely attributable to the search giant's Pixel phones and increasingly popular lineup of smart speaker and smart-home devices. Google almost certainly has a Pixel Watch smartwatch in the works, too. In contrast, critics have mostly panned Google's laptop and tablet lineup, the Pixelbook and convertible Pixel Slate.  The company is now reportedly slimming down its hardware efforts.  Business Insider (subscription required) reports that Google has been moving laptop and tablet employees out of the hardware segment as part of ""road-map cutbacks."" The impacted workers aren't being laid off, but instead being asked to transition to other temporary positions within the company.  The shift isn't all that surprising, considering the underwhelming reception that the Pixelbook (released in October 2017) and Pixel Slate (released in October 2018) have received. While there isn't hard data on unit volumes -- either from Google directly or from third-party researchers -- the Pixelbook was derided as an overpriced Chromebook while the Pixel Slate suffers from software quirks that hinder its usability and otherwise compelling hardware.  It may also be telling that when discussing hardware successes on the earnings call last month, CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted the growing Google Home portfolio and noted advancements in the Pixel 3's camera system -- without ever mentioning the Pixelbook or Pixel Slate. ""It was another record year for our Google Home family of devices with millions sold this holiday season,"" Pichai said.  Google may be recognizing that its first-party efforts in laptops and tablets simply aren't worth the trouble. Third-party Chromebook manufacturers are helping drive volume with low-cost models in key markets like education, and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) dominates the tablet market with the iPad.  Instead, Google is probably reorienting its hardware strategy to build on the momentum of its successes while preparing to take a fresh shot at the smartwatch market, which is now booming. Within the broader wearables market, smartwatch volumes soared an estimated 54% in 2018, according to IDC.  Google has so far struggled in making a name for itself in wearables and smartwatches, as Wear OS (initially named Android Wear) failed to gain any meaningful traction and many prominent hardware partners ditched the platform. Apple and Fitbit (NYSE: FIT) currently lead the way in smartwatches, but Google hopes to take another swing with its forthcoming Pixel Watch. As part of those efforts, Google recently bought smartwatch tech and acqui-hired employees from Fossil for $40 million.  The Pixel Watch, which will be Google's first first-party smartwatch, is expected to debut as soon as this fall, presumably around the same time Apple unveils the Apple Watch Series 5. Fitbit might similarly refresh its smartwatch offerings then.

"Fri, 17 May 2024 23:53:10 GMT"," Microchip startup, Ampere Computing, is collaborating with mobile innovator Qualcomm to develop and build new technology that would improve performance and reduce power costs in artificial intelligence operations.  Announced on Friday, Ampere uses Arm technology in its AI chips, which are otherwise employed by several existing tech giants, including Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL).  ARM technology refers to the architecture and processors originally developed by Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ: ARM), a company known for designing reduced instruction set computing (RISC) architectures. Beyond that, ARM stands for Advanced RISC Machine, which focuses on energy efficiency and performance. These processors are characterized by their low power consumption, making them ideal for a wide range of applications.  Known primarily for its smartphone chips, Qualcomm is expanding into artificial intelligence offerings. Additionally, both companies aim to create AI chips that are more energy-efficient than current market offerings.  The next-gen Ampere and Qualcomm CPU chip features 256 cores for processing operations, a significant upgrade from the previous version’s 192 cores. It combines Ampere CPUs with Qualcomm Cloud AI 100 inferencing chips and will be produced by TSMC using its 3-nanometer manufacturing process.  This development highlights the growing interest among businesses in capitalizing on the AI boom. Ampere and Qualcomm are particularly focused on enhancing server-level artificial intelligence solutions for the foreseeable future.  “We are extending our product family to include a new 256-core product that delivers 40 per cent more performance than any other CPU in the market,” said Renee James, chief executive of Ampere.  “It is not just about cores. It is about what you can do with the platform. We have several new features that enable efficient performance, memory, caching, and AI compute.”  Read more: Verses AI onboards chief product officer in push for AI product Genius  Read more: Verses AI raises CAD$10M in private placement and leans into AI product, Genius  Ampere has started shipping its 192-core AmpereOne processors, which feature an eight-channel DDR5 memory subsystem introduced last year. Later this year, the company plans to launch 192-core AmpereOne CPUs with a 12-channel DDR5 memory subsystem, necessitating a brand-new platform.  Super Micro Computer Inc (NASDAQ: SMCI) has agreed to pair Ampere processors with Qualcomm’s AI 100 Ultra products in their servers. The chip companies have developed hardware and software to ensure the new offering operates smoothly and efficiently for AI inference tasks, such as image or voice recognition.  For those looking to avoid the high cost and frequent back orders of Nvidia gear, Ampere’s new server offers “five times better performance per dollar,” according to Jeff Wittich, Ampere’s chief product officer.  Additionally, Ampere is developing standards to enable the combination of different companies’ chips on single pieces of silicon, Wittich said.  This approach will allow customers to specify their desired products more precisely and avoid dependency on single suppliers. Such products might feature Ampere processors and Qualcomm accelerators on the same chip, enhancing efficiency and performance.

"Fri, 17 May 2024 13:49:58 GMT"," Google on Thursday asked that a judge, rather than a jury, decide whether it violated U.S. antitrust laws by building a monopoly on the technology that powers online advertising.  To bolster its case, the tech giant wrote a multimillion-dollar check to the U.S. government that it says renders moot the government's best argument for demanding a jury trial.  The antitrust case set to go before a jury in Alexandria, Virginia, in September is one of two major lawsuits the Justice Department has brought against Google. While the Virginia case focuses on advertising technology, an ongoing case in the District of Columbia focuses on Google's dominance as a search engine.  Both sides in the D.C. case have presented evidence and made closing arguments. A judge there will decide whether Google violated the law.  Google wants a judge to decide the merits of the case in Virginia, as well. The company argues in court papers filed Thursday that it's unprecedented for a jury to decide a federal antitrust case brought by the government. It says that this case in particular involves ""a complicated, intricate technology ecosystem, which DOJ has acknowledged to this Court is ‘highly technical, often abstract, and outside the everyday knowledge of most prospective jurors.’”  A Department of Justice spokesperson did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Thursday evening.  Google, based in Mountain View, California, makes two primary arguments for striking the government's demand for a jury trial. For starters, Google argues that the constitutional right to a jury trial does not apply to a civil suit brought by the government.  The right to a jury trial, based in the Bill of Rights, “protects citizens against the federal government, not the other way around,” Google's lawyers write in their court filing.  The company acknowledges in the court papers, though, that the Justice Department has a stronger argument for demanding a jury in a case where it seeks monetary damages, as opposed to merely seeking equitable relief, like forcing Google to sell off parts of its advertising technology.  In the Virginia case, the Department of Justice seeks monetary damages on behalf of federal agencies, including the Army, that it says were harmed by Google's monopolistic practices and overpaid for online ads that they purchased.  In its court filing, Google contends that the damage claim was tacked on to the lawsuit at the last minute for the sole purpose of allowing them to seek a jury.  The Department of Justice “manufactured a damages claim at the last minute in an attempt to secure a jury trial in a case even they describe as ‘highly technical’ and ‘outside the everyday knowledge of most prospective jurors,” the company said in a written statement Thursday.  Google's filing Thursday said the company has cut a check to the government that is triple the amount of the losses the government can claim. The exact amount of the check is redacted, but in other court papers, Google said the maximum amount of damages the government was able to demonstrate during the discovery process was less than $1 million.  Because the law allows antitrust damages to be trebled, the check amount would be less than $3 million.  Google says it still disputes that the damages are legitimate, but says that paying the government's claimed damages eliminates the need for a jury to decide the damages question.  While Google says it's unprecedented for a jury to decide a government antitrust suit, Google has defended itself in front of a jury on antitrust cases brought by private companies.  Last year, a jury in San Francisco ruled in favor of Epic Games, the maker of the popular Fortnite game, in a case the company brought against Google over the Google Play store, which allows users of Android phones to download apps.  In that case, Google tried unsuccessfully at the last minute to switch the trial from a jury trial to a bench trial.",1
"Fri, 17 May 2024 22:11:00 GMT"," Shares of Dell Technologies (NYSE: DELL) were moving higher this week, primarily on reports that Dell had won a substantial percentage of contracts relating to Tesla's AI server buildout.  Additionally, AI stocks were up broadly this week after Alphabet announced new products at its annual developer conference, including adding an AI overview to Google searches. That seemed to stoke another round of investor enthusiasm for AI stocks.  Dell stock finished the week up 14.2%, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.  The main reason for Dell's surge seemed to be that it won the spoils in Tesla's AI server ramp.  According to multiple Wall Street analysts, Dell was a winner from Tesla's AI server buildout, which is expected to add to its $2.9 billion AI backlog. Evercore ISI estimates that the orders could add $2.5 billion to $3 billion in revenue this year for Dell.  That wouldn't be a major driver for Dell as the company brought in $88.4 billion in revenue last year, but investors are closely watching its position in AI, as that's expected to be a significant driver of demand in the future.  Super Micro Computer has claimed an early lead in the AI server market with its revenue tripling in its most recent quarter, but Dell, which is a much larger business, is likely to benefit from the AI boom as well.  Dell hasn't made any announcements about a deal with Tesla so the details are still unclear, but we're likely to learn more when the company reports earnings on May 30.  Analysts expect revenue to rise 6.8% to $21.66 billion and for earnings per share to fall $1.31 to $1.22, reflecting challenges in the PC market.  However, investors will be keeping a close eye on AI-related demand, including from Tesla. That news is likely to move the stock as investors look past the overall results.

"Fri, 17 May 2024 11:10:48 GMT"," Walt Disney Co DIS CEO Bob Iger has voiced his concerns about the revenue share with major tech companies, including Apple Inc. AAPL and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL GOOG.  What Happened: Iger expressed his dissatisfaction with the current revenue-sharing model at the MoffettNathanson-hosted conference. He pointed out that Disney is losing a significant portion of its earnings to the Big Tech app stores that distribute its streaming services, such as Disney+ and Hulu, reported Business Insider.  “We have to look at the way we’re distributing,” Iger told analyst Michael Nathanson at a MoffettNathanson-hosted conference. “Unlike Netflix, we distribute largely through third-party app stores. There’s obviously an advantage to that to some extent, but there’s a cost to that, too. And we’re looking at that.”  He mentioned that Disney’s distribution model is different from that of Netflix, which used to allow customers to sign up for its service via third-party distributors like Apple. However, Netflix stopped this practice in 2018, a move that did not seem to affect its growth and had clear benefits for the company’s margins.  Iger’s comments suggest that Disney might be considering a similar move, which could have significant implications for Apple and Google. The revenue-sharing deals between Disney and these tech giants vary. For example, Apple charges video companies like Disney 15% of the revenue for signups made within Apple-distributed apps.  Why It Matters: Iger’s demand for better app store deals comes in the wake of Disney’s recent strategic moves in the streaming industry. The company has been expanding its streaming offerings and is now set to launch a new streaming bundle with Warner Bros. Discovery that includes Disney+, Hulu, and Max.  Disney’s streaming business, including Disney+ and Hulu, has been a key focus for the company. However, Iger has previously admitted that Disney lags behind Netflix in terms of technology, leading to higher marketing expenses and customer acquisition and retention costs.  Amid these challenges, Disney has been working to enhance its streaming services and content strategy, with Iger expressing confidence in securing long-term NBA rights. However, the current app store revenue-sharing model could be a significant hurdle for Disney’s streaming ambitions.

"Fri, 17 May 2024 14:40:37 GMT"," TikTok confirmed testing the ability for users to upload 60-minute videos. This feature is currently available to select users in specific markets, and there are no immediate plans for a broader rollout.  Initially recognized for 15-second videos at launch, TikTok has gradually increased its video length limits, adapting to the demand for longer formats such as cooking demonstrations, beauty tutorials, and educational content, TechCrunch reports.  This extension offers creators more versatility in their content, challenging platforms like Alphabet Inc GOOG GOOGL YouTube by encouraging creators to post longer videos on TikTok.  Moreover, this could pave the way for uploading full TV show episodes directly rather than in segments.  Networks might leverage this extended format to debut show episodes on TikTok, similar to strategies employed on YouTube.  TikTok also enhances the user experience for longer videos by testing features like horizontal full-screen viewing and video-scrubbing thumbnails.  Recently, Amazon.com, Inc's AMZN Twitch launched a short-form video platform, Discovery Feed, that lets users browse through short clips extracted from longer videos.  TikTok is actively working to maintain its presence in the U.S. after President Joe Biden signed legislation that gives TikTok parent ByteDance nine months, with an option to extend for another 90 days, to either divest the app or face a nationwide ban.

"Fri, 17 May 2024 21:14:09 GMT"," Twitter Inc. (TWTR) sold off more than 15% at the end of April after posting weak Q1 2021 earnings and dropped to the lowest low since January this week, closing under the critical 200-day moving average for the fifth day in a row. A market wide decline generated most of downside but outrage following a report that Facebook Inc. (FB) would release an Instagram for children contributed to bearish sector sentiment.  Along with Facebook and Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), Twitter performance is levered to advertising revenue that’s projected to grow rapidly as U.S. and world economies emerge from the pandemic. However, user growth appears to be stumbling as customers return to normalcy, potentially forcing these issues to miss lofty quarterly estimates. April earnings stoked those fears, with weaker than expected Q1 user growth and lower Q2 guidance.  CEO Ned Segal noted after the report that Twitter grew 30% on an annualized basis in Q1 and now expects Q2, Q3, and Q4 to book “low double digit growth with the low point in Q2”. This outlook isn’t too exciting, given rapid 2020 growth as a result of lockdowns and a hotly-contested presidential election. It’s even worse after months of bullish hype about a new ad platform that was expected to bring profits closer to deeper-pocketed rivals.  Wall Street remains skeptical about the long-term outlook, posting a consensus ‘Hold’ rating based upon 10 ‘Buy’, 1 ‘Overweight’, and 27 ‘Hold’ recommendations. In addition, four analysts now recommend that shareholders close positions and move to the sidelines. Price targets currently range from a low of $30 to a Street-high $83 while the stock is set to open Wednesday’s session about $13 below the median $65 target.  Twitter came public in the 40s in 2013 and topped out in the 70s in early 2014. The subsequent decline ended in 2017, yielding a two-legged advance that finally reached the prior high in February 2021. The subsequent breakout failed, yielding a double top pattern that broke to the downside in April. The stock is now trading below the 200-day moving average for the first time since July 2020, fully engaged in a downtrend that could reach eventually support in the 40s.

"Fri, 17 May 2024 07:31:00 GMT"," When it comes to investing, hedge funds generally have a bad reputation -- and for good reason. A report released by The American Enterprise Institute a few years ago helps illustrate why. An analysis of hedge fund returns between 2011 and 2020 found that the S&P 500beat the average hedge fund's return every single year, and usually by a wide margin. In fact, during that 10-year stretch, hedge funds returned roughly 5%, on average, compared to 14.4% gains for the S&P 500.  However, not all hedge fund managers are cut from the same cloth. Billionaire Bill Ackman has developed a reputation for being a different breed of hedge fund manager. He doesn't trade in and out of stocks every quarter in an attempt to buttress his performance. He generally buys high-quality North American companies with limited downside that generate predictable, recurring cash flows. At any given time, he has between eight and 12 stocks, and holds them for the long term.  Ackman helms Pershing Square Capital Management -- the hedge fund he founded -- which had $10.8 billion in assets under management to close out the first quarter. His investing strategy has been extremely successful: Pershing Square has returned 31% annualized over the past five years, nearly twice the returns of the S&P 500 and vastly outperforming the industry.  To close out the first quarter, the hedge owned stakes in just six companies, but one major artificial intelligence (AI) player is Ackman's largest holding.  Ackman has a long track record of buying stocks and holding them for years, and there's not a lot of turnover in Pershing Square's holdings. So, when Ackman adds a new stock to the fold, it tends to attract a lot of attention. That's what happened in early 2023, when Pershing Square added Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) to its portfolio. The hedge fund holds 9.4 million Class C shares and 4.3 million Class A shares worth a combined total of nearly $2.4 billion, accounting for 22% of Pershing Square's total portfolio.  Just six companies make up Pershing Square's $11 billion portfolio, so a stock must represent a compelling opportunity in order to make the cut. Fortunately, we don't need to guess as to why Ackman singled out Alphabet.  Ackman noted that at the time, Alphabet stock was selling for just 15 times earnings. This marked its lowest multiple in more than a decade and near its lowest valuation ever.  The purchase came on the heels of the worst advertising slump in more than a decade, which helped push down the stock's valuation. The economic downturn and the resulting bear market saw marketing demand dry up as businesses sought to retain precious capital and shore up their financial positions.  In the fourth quarter of 2022 -- just before Ackman took his initial stake -- Alphabet's revenue grew just 1% year over year, while its advertising revenue fell 4%. It's always darkest before the dawn, or so the saying goes, and Ackman was clearly on to something.  Alphabet's advertising revenue turned the corner shortly after that and has been improving ever since. In the first quarter, Alphabet's revenue grew 15% year over year and 16% in constant currency, while advertising revenue rose 13%. At the same time, its diluted earnings per share soared 62%. Ackman also pointed to Google Search and YouTube as ""two of the highest return and most resilient digital ad formats.""  Let's not forget Google Cloud, Alphabet's ""Big Three"" cloud platform. It's the world's third-largest cloud infrastructure provider, and it's gaining ground on No. 1 Amazon Web Services.  Ackman also noted there were ""misplaced concerns over the company's AI positioning."" Recent events have helped to put those concerns to rest.  Just this week, Alphabet hosted the Google I/O 2024 Developers Conference, unleashing a tidal wave of AI-related announcements. Many of its most recent AI innovations directly benefit Google Search, ensuring it maintains its industry dominance for years to come. The company also debuted new high-end AI processors, unveiled its vision for the future of AI assistants, and introduced the latest version of its Gemini large language model (LLM), which underpins the company's AI systems.  Ackman noted that Alphabet has been investing in AI for years and its leadership is undeniable. ""AI is deeply embedded in and will continue to enhance applications, including Search and 14 other products with over 500 million users each,"" he wrote.  Since its IPO (as Google) in 2004, the stock has generated returns of 8,083% (as of this writing). This isn't just in the distant past; Alphabet stock has gained 50% over the past year.  As a result of the rebound in Alphabet's stock price, it isn't the screaming buy it was just a couple of years ago. That said, Alphabet is still attractively priced, selling for 26 times earnings, a discount to the multiple of 28 for the S&P 500.  Furthermore, Alphabet has a long history of outpacing the returns of the broader market. Over the past 10 years, the stock has soared 559%, more than triple the 183% gains of the S&P 500.  The company's long track record of execution and its strong position in AI make Alphabet stock a buy.  Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

"Fri, 17 May 2024 14:55:34 GMT"," Last year, a Nielsen study found that 18- to 24-year-olds across America spent more time on their smartphones than watching TV. Users across older age groups still watched more TV, but the message was clear: Smartphone usage could eventually overtake TV viewership.  That's why it wasn't surprising when eMarketer recently reported that advertisers would spend more money on mobile ads than TV ads in 2018, and that the gap would widen over the next four years. eMarketer expects this transition to bolster ad prices as demand outstrips supply.  That's great news for Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary Google and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), which hold a near-duopoly in internet ads. Last December, research firm Pivotal estimated that the two companies accounted for 73% of all digital advertising in the U.S., up from 63% in the second quarter of 2015. That growth could hurt smaller digital ad players like Twitter and Snap.  Google's YouTube and Facebook's Watch, a new video platform the social network launched last August, will also likely pull more advertisers away from TV networks. The networks are fighting back with their own mobile apps, but they'll face a tough uphill battle over the next few years.

"Fri, 17 May 2024 18:59:24 GMT"," ChatGPT parent OpenAI has disbanded a team dedicated to ensuring the safety of potentially ultra-capable AI systems after the group’s leaders, including co-founder Ilya Sutskever, departed.  The so-called superalignment team, established less than a year ago under Sutskever and Jan Leike, has been absorbed into broader research efforts across the company, Bloomberg reports.  This integration aims to maintain the focus on safety while addressing the recent high-profile exits that have stirred debates over the company’s speed versus safety in AI development.  Leike resigned following Sutskever’s departure, citing challenges such as insufficient resources and increasing difficulties in conducting crucial research.  Other team members, Leopold Aschenbrenner and Pavel Izmailov, have also left OpenAI.  John Schulman will lead OpenAI’s alignment work, and Jakub Pachocki, who will take over Sutskever’s role, has been appointed the new chief scientist.  In April, the United States and the United Kingdom agreed to address the concerns about AI safety.  The Biden Administration has actively engaged tech companies and banking firms to address AI dangers. AI giants like Meta Platforms Inc META and Microsoft Corp MSFT joined the White House’s AI safety initiative in February.  In 2023, the AI safety forum, the Frontier Model Forum, spearheaded by OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet Inc GOOG GOOGL, and AI startup Anthropic, appointed its first director and announced plans to establish an advisory board soon to guide its strategy. The forum also announced plans to develop a fund to support research into the technology.

"Fri, 17 May 2024 18:54:19 GMT"," The generative AI revolution is far from over, but that doesn’t mean AI stocks, especially those that have enjoyed impressive gains in recent months, are immune to a substantial pullback. The bears and skeptics may have been calling for such a correction for quite some time. And though a growth-to-value rotation is always possible, I’m not so sure one will be on the table now that the Fed is done with the rate hikes.  Though fewer rate cuts than expected could be in for the year (perhaps two or less), it seems like the higher-growth names, especially those with AI exposure, are worth picking up as long as you can justify the price of admission.  With some companies (like OpenAI) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: , ) recently unveiling ample new AI features, tools, and projects, it’s getting harder to sit on the sidelines if you’re one of the folks who’ve been actively avoiding AI stocks, dismissing them because of their past-year rallies.  In this piece, we’ll go through three AI stocks that still look cheap, perhaps cheap enough to take on less damage come the next inevitable market correction.  Alphabet stock stands out as the cheapest Magnificent Seven member right now, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 22.9 times. If that’s not a cheap price to pay for magnificence in the realm of AI, I really don’t know what is.  With Google I/O 2024 wrapped up (the word “AI” was used more than 120 times in the two-hour presentation!), I think it’s time for investors to re-evaluate where the $2.12 trillion AI juggernaut stands.  Personally, I was impressed with I/O, which unveiled plenty of new AI innovations. As part of I/O, Google revealed its multimodal AI assistant, Project Astra, a product that should compete with OpenAI’s recently unveiled ChatGPT-4o. Additionally, it pulled the curtain on Veo, a text-to-video generator that seems to be the answer to OpenAI Sora. Google also announced its Search AI Overviews will be coming very soon.  After such an AI-packed event, I find it absurd that GOOG stock isn’t well above the $180 mark. In any case, the stock looks cheap, and recent momentum looks tough to stand in the way of.  Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stock is serious about spending money to advance its AI capabilities by leaps and bounds. While the social media and metaverse titan has been doing a fantastic job of innovating with its new Meta AI and LLaMA 3 models, it’s clear Mark Zuckerberg is not willing to pull any punches in the global AI battle. He wants to not only come out ahead but perhaps much ahead of the competition.  As it stands, Meta’s AI footing looks strong. As it starts spending heavily, future quarters could be in for upsetting surprises as costs pile up. However, in five years from now, I think AI could help Meta become a top-two growth stock in the Magnificent Seven cohort.  So, if you’re fed up with the dwindling growth prospects of some other Magnificent Seven stocks, META stock may be worth adding as we head into June. The stock’s not expensive either at 23.9 times forward P/E at writing.  Recently, Meta turned out the lights on its Workplace app, an effort that should free up cash to spend on things like AI.  If you’re looking for a much smaller firm that could have greater AI upside, perhaps dating app firm Bumble (NASDAQ:BMBL) is more your cup of tea.  The company seems poised to make a huge splash in AI, a move that could change the way we think about matching and online dating. Indeed, dating apps aren’t exactly a great experience for many. Some may argue it’s based too much on looks, with less about other aspects (think personality) of a person that are arguably more important.  Bumble founder and ex-CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd believes “AI dating concierges” could play a big role in the future of dating. She discussed the incredible idea that AI could date on behalf of its customers during the Bloomberg Technology Summit. Undoubtedly, having AI find you the perfect match seems to be the holy grail of the dating app market. But for now, investors don’t seem all too impressed by the potential.  I probably won’t be the first to mention that AI-powered matching seems to be eerily similar to an episode of Black Mirror. Imagine interacting with an AI and having it match you with someone with whom it thinks you’d have chemistry. That’s a ground breaker that could help get past the icebreaker. And I think the powerful idea is more than worth getting behind, especially while BMBL stock is in a historic rut.  At just shy of 1.0 times price-to-book (P/B), I find BMBL to be absurdly undervalued relative to its market opportunity to be had in the nascent AI dating scene.
