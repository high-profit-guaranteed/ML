All three of the major indexes (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are moving lower on Tuesday. Rising Treasury yields (^TNX) and oil prices (CL=F, BZ=F) have investors on edge. There are also growing concerns that the Federal Reserve may not cut rates in June like many have been hoping. The declines are also weighing on the price of bitcoin (BTC-USD). Shares of Tesla (TSLA) are falling sharply after the EV maker reported it delivered 386,810 vehicles in the first quarter, well short of the estimated 449,080. Tesla produced 433,371 vehicles in the quarter compared to an estimate of 452,976. Trending tickers on Yahoo Finance include GE Aerospace (GE), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), and Humana (HUM).
