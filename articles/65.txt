Gary Black of Future Fund anticipates Tesla's first-quarter deliveries to be around 409,000 units, marking a decrease from the previous year's 423,000 units. This could signify Tesla's first year-over-year sales decline since 2020.

There are varying estimates for the first quarter, with some expecting about 457,000 units, an 8% increase from the first quarter of 2023. However, the company's own number suggests slower growth.

The potential slowdown is attributed to a combination of slowing demand and production issues, particularly with the refreshed Model 3 at Tesla's Fremont, California plant.

Tesla's shares have seen a 29% decrease year-to-date. Despite this, there is potential for a stock rally if first-quarter deliveries rise year-over-year.
