It's been more than 20 years since Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) was founded, and 15 years since it made its first electric vehicle (EV). It's been a mainstream, mass-produced brand of cars for over a decade, in fact. And yet, the evolving company is still making as many headlines now as it ever has. Maybe more.

Not all of these headlines are bullish for Tesla stock, mind you. The EV manufacturer along with its CEO seem to be on the defensive these days. That's a big reason why Tesla stock is down by more than 50% from its late-2021 peak, and still teasing a new 52-week low; this sell-off and all the drama causing it are keeping investors guessing as to what's next for the storied company.

If all of this uncertainty is making it difficult for you to make a decision on the stock, it's time to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Here's what (still) matters most about Tesla, for better or worse.
