The big business news of the day is Tesla’s announcement that its deliveries were down for the first quarter of 2024. When I checked late morning, TSLA stock was down about 6 percent, or $10.40. Tesla CEO Elon Musk in February 2024 disclosed owning about 715 million shares, or 20.5 percent of the company, which means the morning’s decline sent the market value of his stake down by about $7.4 billion.

In related news, Forbes released its “Billionaires 2024” package, listing Musk as the world’s second richest person and the richest American, with net worth of $195 billion. (That calculation preceded today’s slide.) Forbes reports, “Musk is a long way from November 2021, when he became the first person ever worth $300 billion.”

Even if you take the Forbes calculations with a pile of salt, what are the implications of the decline to $195 billion from $300 billion, the idea that the richest man in America is $105 billion less rich than he was in 2021?

It’s a reminder that the biggest fortunes are often built by accepting levels of risk and volatility that many individuals find difficult to tolerate.

It’s also a reminder of the practical difficulty of taxing unrealized capital gains on an annual basis. In March 2022, when Biden floated a revised version of what I called the Biden-Wyden wealth tax, I warned of “practical issues having to do with the valuation of assets whose worth may fluctuate wildly over time.”
