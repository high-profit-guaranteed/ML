Tesla Inc. shares pared a steep drop in intraday trading after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk denied a report saying the carmaker had called off plans for a less-expensive vehicle.

The stock fell as much as 6.2% on Friday after Reuters said Tesla had canceled the project, citing anonymous sources and company messages it had reviewed. Shares were down 1.3% as of 1 p.m. Friday in New York.
