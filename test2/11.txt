Tesla Inc. may be headed for another vehicle sales decline this quarter after surprising investors with a drop in the first three months of the year, according to Robert W. Baird analysts.

The carmaker faces a tough year-ago comparison in the current period, Ben Kallo , who rates Teslaâ€™s stock the equivalent of a buy, said in a note published Tuesday. He estimates the company will deliver 444,510 vehicles in the second quarter, 4.6% fewer than a year ago.
