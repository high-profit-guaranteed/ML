Tesla Inc.’s disastrous sales report on Tuesday, and traders’ aggressive selling of the stock in the months leading up to it, have the share price plunging toward a critical level for investors.

The electric-vehicle giant’s stock price has sunk more than 33% this year, making it the worst performer in the Nasdaq 100 Index and second worst in the S&P 500 Index. The shares, which traded for around $400 as recently as January 2022, are now at $166 and dropping . So, technical analysts are watching the key $150 level to gauge whether the shares will find the much-needed support.
