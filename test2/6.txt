When Elon Musk announced he’ll unveil a Tesla Inc. robotaxi in August, it was a clear attempt to arrest a spiral for the once high-flying carmaker.

Tesla shares already had been sinking before the company reported anemic quarterly delivery figures on April 2.

Musk’s vague denial didn’t do the trick — the stock closed last week as the worst performer in the S&P 500 this year.
