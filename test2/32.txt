Tesla taxis have long been in the pipeline. More recently, five years ago, the company said it planned to start operating robotaxis by 2020.
• Earlier today, Tesla agreed to settle a lawsuit over an autopilot-related fatal crash of an Apple engineer dating back to 2018. Previously, Tesla had stated that it was the driver’s responsibility to avoid crashes that involve the driver-assistance technology.
