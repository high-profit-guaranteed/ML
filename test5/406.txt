This move contrasts with Tesla's price hike on its popular Model Y. Today, the US electric vehicle manufacturer increased the prices of all three Model Y variants in China by 5,000 RMB ($690), plus it raised US Model Y cars by $1,000. Despite announcing the price increase in advance, Tesla had to reduce production at its Shanghai factory. In addition, Xiaomi entered China's EV market and received over 88,898 pre-orders for its SU7 model within 24 hours. These actions reveal the intense competition in China's automobile market.

Chinese automakers are capitalizing on Tesla's ( NASDAQ: TSLA ) recent price increase and Xiaomi's entry into the market by offering incentives to potential car buyers. Nio ( NYSE: NIO ) is providing up to 1 billion yuan ($138 million) in incentives, including battery swap benefits and additional assisted driving functions. Xpeng has cut the prices of some models by up to 20,000 yuan, while Chery Automobile will cover purchase taxes on selected models and offer better trade-ins for used cars.
