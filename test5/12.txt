Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock is falling on Tuesday after the company released its electric vehicle (EV) delivery data for the month of February.

The big news from this delivery update is the company shipping out 60,365 EVs from its Shanghai Gigafactory. That’s 19% lower than the deliveries reported by that same factory in February 2023.

Investors will note that it’s common for EV sales to drop in China during the Lunar New Year. So that explains some of the slowdown that Tesla experienced last month.

However, there are other issues at play here that traders need to keep in mind. Among these is a slowdown in demand that’s affecting the overall EV market. There’s also the fact that Tesla is facing stiffer competition from local Chinese EV companies, reports Investopedia.

What This Means for TSLA Stock

With the disappointing delivery data comes negative comments concerning TSAL stock from analysts. For example, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said the following about the EV company’s delivery data to Reuters:

TSLA stock is down 2.7% as of Tuesday morning. This builds on a 7.2% decline during normal trading hours on Monday, which is when it reported the delivery data.
