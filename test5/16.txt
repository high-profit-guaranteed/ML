Tesla's (TSLA) shares are trading lower due to slow demand for electric vehicles in the crucial Chinese market. Barclays Senior Autos Analyst Dan Levy joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the key factors driving this trend.

Levy notes that investors are witnessing a pivot "from supply constraints to demand constraints" in the EV market. While Tesla's demand results could have been temporarily impacted by the Chinese New Year holiday, he cites broader pressures on the company's first quarter deliveries, such as production slowdowns related to the remodeling of the Model 3.

Despite the competition from domestic automakers like BYD (1211.HK) and uncertainty around pricing dynamics, Levy believes "there is still room for Tesla to grow" in the Chinese market.

- All right. Well, Tesla shares tumbling to new multi-week lows. And troubles in China now slowing China's shipments and new price cuts in the region, spelling some caution for the year ahead. For more on this, we want to bring in Dan Levy. He is Barclays' Senior Autos Analyst. Dan, it's great to see you again. So we've seen the reaction obviously play out in shares over the last two days. Concerns about what we're seeing demand-wise in China. Some of this a bit overdone, or what do you think?

DAN LEVY: Yeah. Thank you, Seana and Brad, for having me. Look, I think what we're seeing playing out is the broader theme that we've been talking about into the year, which is that this is really a year about pivoting from supply constraints to demand constraints, and you're seeing that playing out in the EV market where--

And this is something we've been seeing in the back half of last year especially, where you're seeing some questions on demand. What's the sustainable pace of volume? Look, the February data for Tesla in China was probably impacted by Chinese New Year. So we don't want to focus too much into that.

But we are below consensus on first quarter deliveries at roughly 450,000 units. And look, in addition to the dynamics around Chinese New Year, you have some slowdown in Fremont related to the refresh of Model 3. You have some issues with Berlin production around Red Sea delays. And just broadly, they're sitting on a lot of inventory. And so this I think underpins our more conservative view versus consensus deliveries in 2024. We're at roughly 2 million. Consensus is 2.1 million. Just think that there's going to be some challenges on meeting some of the consensus numbers.

- Dan, we had continued to monitor, at least for I want to say a couple of years now, a shift in sentiment from some of the consumers within the region towards other homegrown brands and perhaps why BYD has been able to see their own successes within the region skyrocket and move past Tesla even. How much of it is tied back to that mindset as well?

DAN LEVY: Listen, I think this is a key theme in the auto industry. It's the rise of BYD and some of the other domestic Chinese that have really figured out the cost dynamics. Tesla has actually fared OK in China. They've generally maintained in the BEV market. Call it high single digit, low double digit market share, which is very respectable.

It is obviously below where BYD is, where they've been pacing lately at roughly a quarter of the market. So I think there is still room for Tesla to grow volumes even with BYD doing well, but it is a reminder that of the regions where Tesla's competing, Europe, US, China, China is by far going to be the most competitive and the most intense. We've seen some price cuts lately. And that's where it's a bit trickier for Tesla versus other regions.
