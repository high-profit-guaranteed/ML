Elon Musk, the CEO of electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), stated in a post on social media platform X that xAI‘s chatbot ‘Grok’ will go open-source this week. Grok is considered a rival to Microsoft-backed (MSFT) ChatGPT. Open-source software is when the source code is distributed freely and can be modified.

Musk had previously expressed discomfort about focusing more on Tesla’s AI and robotics business unless he had 25% voting control. Musk has also sued OpenAI, alleging that the company had deviated from its original founding mission to develop AI for the benefit of humanity, not for profit.

xAI launched Grok for Premium+ subscribers on X back in December and is aiming for a “maximum truth-seeking AI.”
