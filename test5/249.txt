While Elon Musk’s Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) still inspires optimism and excitement among investors and electric vehicle (EV) enthusiasts alike, it is undoubtedly that the recent woes affecting the entire industry have taken their toll.

As of March 20, TSLA is one of the worst-performing stocks featured in the S&P 500 index – a significant feature given that its main competitor for the spot is Boeing (NYSE: BA), a company mired in airplane quality controversy and suspicious whistleblower deaths.

Still, Tesla has recently put a dent in its protracted losing streak with nearly a 6% surge between Friday, March 15, and Monday, March 18 after price increases in some models reignited hope that the stock may recover its losses within 2024 and continue surging by 2025.

Seeking insight on whether TSLA shares are bound for a bull run or not, Finbold reached out to a string of experts for their Tesla stock prediction for 2025

Nathan Jacobs, Senior Researcher at The Money Mongers, offered an extraordinarily bullish forecast for Tesla stock in 2025 by placing the target range for the company in the year between $800 and $1,200.

According to Jacobs, Tesla’s dominance in the EV industry, along with its penchant for innovation – particularly in terms of battery technology – remain its biggest strengths and are likely to drive significant future growth.

Adam Garcia, the owner of The Stock Dork, is similarly bullish and predicts the exact same range for TSLA shares in 2025 – between $800 and $1,200. Garcia based the target on factors including market dynamics, company performance, technological advancements, and regulatory changes, but acknowledged that some uncertainty exists.

Markus Kraus, the founder and owner of Trading Verstehen, offered a detailed breakdown of factors likely to impact the price of Tesla shares in the lead-up to 2025.

First, the analyst pointed out that Tesla Motors has been suffering on the supply chain side even facing some production stoppages, but concluded that the EV makers push to boost production, and its work on models with high profit margins is likely to reflect well in the stock market.

The expert continued by highlighting the production capacity boosts with Berlin, Mexico, and Texas – as well as the rollout of the Cybertruck – are likely to facilitate significant growth. Kraus also reflected on the benefits of expanding the budget-friendly offering and expanding into markets like India.

Finally, the analyst made mention of Tesla’s general tendencies for innovation including in fields such as artificial intelligence (AI) and the push to make truly self-driving cars, and Elon Musk’s integration of cryptocurrency payments into its business model.

Finally, after also pointing out Tesla’s non-vehicle operations such as the firm’s building of a nationwide energy station grid, Kraus offered a tempered but bullish forecast that the stock could stand between $450 and $600 by the end of 2025.

Ethan Keller, the President of Dominion, reflected on Tesla’s relentless drive to expand its business in terms of boosting production capacity and expanding to new markets.

The expert stated that this drive alone is likely to boost investor enthusiasm for the EV maker and that, should the push succeed, it is likely to lead to ever-greater growth.

Keller also identified further advances in technology, such as the creation of reliable self-driving cars, as the key factors that can ensure Tesla’s continued dominance in the EV industry.

Finally, the expert acknowledged that Tesla could be significantly impacted by possible changes in the overall state of the global economy and regulatory changes and challenges and offered no concrete price target for the EV maker in 2025.

While analysts remain generally bullish on Tesla’s future, the EV maker is, at press time, haunted by the ghosts of the present and recent past. TSLA shares are among the worst performers of 2024 when it comes to major companies and are down 31.04% since January 1.

Finally, despite the surge between the most recent Friday and Monday, TSLA shares are down 1.06% on the weekly chart and have continued the decline in the latest session having closed 1.43% in the red at $171.32.
