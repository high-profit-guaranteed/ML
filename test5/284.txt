Buying TSLA stock? You’ll want to watch this first. We construct an actual price target for Tesla – not just the usual “going to 10x, get in now!” type of rubbish that you see on Twitter. We look at Tesla’s historical valuation compared to its current market cap with today’s revenues and shares outstanding to determine where we’d be buyers of TSLA shares. We also talk about some of the risks surrounding Tesla stock, like the great almighty Elon Musk himself. It’s a double-edged sword as he’s undoubtedly the greatest entrepreneur of all time, but he is still human and anything can happen. So, before you go and invest in Tesla stock, watch this video and give us your thoughts on our price target.
