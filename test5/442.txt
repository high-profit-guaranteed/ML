Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) tumbled nearly 5% on Tuesday, with about $27 billion in market capitalization annihilated in a single session. Undeterred by the negative catalyst that drove the stock lower, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest accumulated an additional tranche of the stock.

What Happened: Ark through three of its actively-managed exchange-traded funds bought a combined 234,998 shares worth $39.16 million, according to daily trade information released by the firm. The details of the purchase are as follows:

Tesla is the second biggest holding of Ark’s flagship exchange-traded funded, the ARKK. The fund holds $$677.40 million worth of the electric-vehicle giant’s shares and these shares have a weighting of 8.93% weighting in the fund.

Meanwhile, Ark continued to offload Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) as ARKQ sold 1,959 shares of the AI stalwart. The sales would have fetched the firm about $1.75 million. The firm, however, stalled the selling of crypto-linked stocks Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) and Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD) amid the sell-off in cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) fell about 3.75% over the past 24 hours and traded at around the $66,000 level.

Why It’s Important: Tesla reported Tuesday a downbeat deliveries update for the first quarter, with the number coming in well below the company-compiled consensus of 431,000 units. The Elon Musk-led company delivered 386,810 vehicles for the first quarter, down 8.5% from the year-ago period and a steeper 20.16% decline from the fourth quarter.

The first-quarter performance marked the first year-over-year decline since the COVID-19-hit second quarter of 2020.

Tesla blamed the weak performance on the early phase of the production ramp of the updated Model 3 at the Fremont factory and factory shutdowns resulting from shipping diversions caused by the Red Sea conflict and an arson attack at Gigafactory Berlin.

Reacting to the number, Future Fund’s Gary Black said, “This will renew the narrative about TSLA's 60x 2024 P/E with negative volume, revenue and eps growth.” The fund manager also expects second quarter volumes to also fall year-over-year.

Tesla ended Tuesday’s session down 4.90% at $166.63 after falling to as low as $163.43 intraday, according to Benzinga Pro data. ARKK fell 2.97% to $47.78.
