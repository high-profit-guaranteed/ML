Good Morning Traders! In today's Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.

Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.

We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market's pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let's dive into the stock analysis:

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY The SPY is actively trading near the 521.85 mark. Bulls are eyeing an initial move to 522.84, hoping for continued strength to propel the price towards 523.76. If this level holds, the aim is to push beyond to 525.26, with the ultimate bullish target set at 526.31 for the day. This progression outlines a hopeful scenario for SPY, indicating a strong upward momentum if these levels are sequentially breached and sustained.

Conversely, should SPY fail to maintain its stance above 521.85, a bearish narrative may unfold, beginning with a dip towards 520.67. Further bearish pressure could see the price testing 519.71, and if this threshold is compromised, a drop to 518.76 might follow. In a scenario marked by significant selling, the bears aim to drive SPY down to their final target for the day at 518.04, signifying a pronounced downward movement.

Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 QQQ Currently, the QQQ, or 'The Q's,' is navigating the 444.09 level. Bulls are looking to consolidate above 445.43, which could open the path to 446.51 and, potentially, 447.73. A strong bullish day could push the price towards 449.36, setting the highest bull target at 445.09. This path sketches an optimistic trajectory for QQQ, banking on sustained buying pressure to achieve these targets.

If the Q's cannot uphold the 444.09 level, it might indicate a bearish turn, with the first test at 442.53. A confirmation of bearish momentum could lead to further tests at 441.56 and 440.78. The ultimate bearish target for the day is pegged at 440.00, marking a significant downturn if these levels are sequentially breached due to selling activity.

Apple Inc. AAPL Apple's trading activity is centered around the 169.73 level, with bullish objectives including 170.32 and 171.13, aiming for a final push to 172.45. This pathway illustrates a bullish outlook for Apple, with each level acting as a stepping stone for further upward momentum. The sequence of these levels being met and held would indicate strong buying interest and a positive market sentiment towards Apple.

On the flip side, if Apple cannot find support at 169.73, it might signal a shift towards bearish dynamics, with the stock potentially falling to 168.99 and then 168.41. A continued sell-off could bring 168.00 into play, with the day's lowest bear target set at 167.59. This descent would mark a significant bearish trend for Apple, highlighting increased selling pressure.

Microsoft Corp. MSFT Microsoft's current position is around 422.84, with bullish aspirations to secure 423.81 as support and potentially rally towards 426.00. This scenario paints a hopeful picture for Microsoft, with each level representing a milestone in a bullish trend. Achieving and maintaining these levels would signal strong buyer confidence and a potential upward trend for the stock.

Should Microsoft fail to hold at 422.84, it might face bearish challenges, first at 421.62 and then 420.26. A continued downward trajectory could see the stock testing 419.17, with the lowest bear target for the day marked at 417.25. This would indicate a bearish sentiment, with each level breach underscoring the selling pressure faced by Microsoft.

NVIDIA Corporation NVDA NVIDIA is trading around 898.13, with the bulls aiming to push the price up to 903.25 and then 907.51, with a high target of 917.98 for the day. This bullish path suggests a strong buying momentum aiming to break through these key levels, each serving as a testament to the bullish strength in NVIDIA's market.

Conversely, if NVIDIA cannot maintain its ground at 898.13, it could be a cue for the bears to drive the price down to 890.55, and further weakness could lead to tests at 882.97 and 877.25. The ultimate bearish target is set at 865.62, representing a substantial bearish outlook if NVIDIA's price succumbs to these levels.

Alphabet Inc Class A GOOGL Alphabet is currently seen around 153.93, with bulls looking to elevate the price through 154.44 and 154.95, aiming for a high target of 155.59. This upward trajectory implies a positive outlook for Alphabet, with each level breach indicating strong bullish momentum and market support for the stock.

If Alphabet fails to sustain above 153.93, it may indicate bearish control, with the price potentially dropping to 153.54 and then 152.94. A significant bearish move could take the stock down to a low target of 152.27 for the day, highlighting a strong bearish sentiment if these levels are breached.

Meta Platforms Inc META Meta Platforms, formerly Facebook, is positioned around 512.85, with bullish targets set at 515.39 and 520.27, culminating in a high target of 526.29. This optimistic scenario envisions a strong bullish push, with each level serving as a critical juncture in Meta's potential upward trend.

On the other hand, if Meta cannot hold at 512.85, a bearish perspective might emerge, with the price potentially moving down to 508.25 and then 504.54. A continued downward trend could lead to a low bear target of 500.83, marking a significant downturn for Meta if these levels are reached.

Tesla Inc. TSLA Tesla's stock is observed around the 169.70 level, with bulls hoping to propel the price to 172.61 and beyond, targeting a high of 182.53 for the day. This bullish path outlines an aggressive upward momentum for Tesla, with each level breach demonstrating strong buyer interest and a positive market outlook for the stock.

Conversely, if Tesla fails to sustain support at 169.70, it could signal a bearish trend, with initial targets at 166.89 and 164.87. If selling pressure intensifies, the price might be pushed down to the lowest bear target of 162.32 for the day, indicating a significant bearish sentiment if these levels are reached.

Final Word: As today's trading session unfolds, market participants are keenly awaiting the release of Continuing and Initial Jobless Claims at 8:30 AM EST, which could provide valuable insights into the labor market's health. This data is particularly significant as it precedes the highly anticipated Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report due tomorrow. Additionally, the Treasury's planned auction of 4 and 8 Week Bills later in the morning could influence market liquidity and investor sentiment. With a schedule packed with Federal Reserve speakers, of which only two are voting members, the market is poised for potential volatility. Market participants are advised to trade with caution and discipline, keeping a close eye on these developments for any possible impact on trading strategies. Good luck in today's session!
