Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock is in the news on Monday after the electric vehicle (EV) company’s shares were hit with a reduced price target from Mizuho.

This downgrade has the firm dropping TSLA stock from a price target of $270 per share to $195. This represents a potential upside of 14.2% compared to the stock’s prior closing price. It’s also lower than the consensus analyst price prediction of $209.15 per share.

To go along with that price cut, Mizuho dropped TSLA stock from a “buy” rating to a “neutral” rating. For some perspective, the analyst consensus rating for TSLA shares is a reduce rating based on 32 opinions.

Mizuho is taking a more neutral stance on EV stocks in general. This saw the company also downgrade shares of Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) and Nio (NYSE:NIO) from “buy” to “neutral” alongside Tesla.

Here’s what the firm said in a note to clients obtained by Investing.com:

TSLA stock is up slightly on Monday morning. The stock is currently down 30.9% since the start of the year.
