Cathie Wood's ARK ETFs have made significant moves in the stock market on Thursday, March 28th, 2024, with Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ: ) being the centerpieces of the day's trading activity. ARK's largest transaction involved purchasing a hefty 79,951 shares of electric vehicle giant Tesla, amounting to a staggering $14,377,588 in value. This move underscores ARK's continued bullish stance on Tesla, which has been a recurring theme in the fund's investment strategy.

On the flip side, ARK showed a bearish sentiment towards Coinbase, offloading a total of 15,693 shares across their ARKK and ARKW ETFs, totaling $4,028,393. This sale comes amidst a broader context where ARK has been adjusting its holdings in the cryptocurrency exchange company, as observed from previous trades.

Another notable buy for ARK was Twist Bioscience Corp (NASDAQ: ), with the acquisition of 113,673 shares valued at $3,919,444. This purchase aligns with ARK's interest in genomics and biotechnology, sectors that have seen increased focus from the investment firm.

Kratos Defense & Security (NASDAQ: ) also saw increased buying, with ARK purchasing 20,481 shares for $371,320, indicating a growing trend as ARK had bought shares of the same company in the days prior. This suggests a strategic accumulation of stocks in the defense contractor, which specializes in unmanned systems, satellite communications, and microwave electronics.

The fund also divested 25,353 shares of UiPath Inc (NYSE:NYSE: ) from its ARKQ ETF, amounting to $577,541, continuing a selling trend from the previous day. ARK's trades reflect a dynamic approach to portfolio management, with adjustments that respond to market conditions and the fund's forward-looking investment thesis.

In smaller transactions, ARK bought shares of Personalis Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Roblox Corp (NYSE:RBLX), investing $16,585 and $179,551, respectively. These buys, although not as substantial as the ones mentioned earlier, are part of ARK's diversified investment approach, targeting companies with innovative and disruptive potential.
