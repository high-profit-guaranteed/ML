Tesla (TSLA) is offering more value yet its share price is falling. Hence, some people will wonder if Elon Musk’s electric vehicle maker could become a value investment?

Tesla’s share price fell from $175.66 on 20 March 2023 to $172.03 on 20 March 2024. Conversely, Tesla’s total assets grew by 29.49% from $82.34 billion in December 2022 to $106.62 billion in December 2023. However, Tesla’s total liabilities grew by 18.03% from $36.44 billion in December 2022 to $43.01 billion in December 2023.

Impressively, Tesla’s vehicles grew by 38% between 2022 and 2023, a press release claims. Tesla delivered 1.85 million vehicles in 2023 and and 484,507 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2023. However, Tesla produced 494,989 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2023.

However, Tesla’s closest competitor BYD (SHE: 002594) took the lead in electric vehicle sales for the first time in the fourth quarter of 2023. BYD, a Chinese carmaker, claims to have sold 526,000 battery-only vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2024, the BBC reports. In contrast, Tesla claims to have delivered 484,500 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2023.

What Value Does Tesla (TSLA) offer?

Thus, Tesla Motors (TSLA) is having some problems but it is still expanding. Skeptics will wonder what value Tesla offers.

Tesla’s revenues are growing. The quarterly revenues grew by 3.49% from $24.32 billion in December 2022 to $25.17 billion in 2023. This growth is small, but it is there.

Tesla is making more money. Its quarterly net income grew by an impressive 115.03% from $3.69 billion in December 2022 to $7.93 billion in December 2023. Similarly, Tesla’s quarterly net profit margin grew by 107.78% in 2023 to 31.50 in December 2023.

However, mindless market watchers dislike Tesla because its earnings per share (EPS) fell by -40.34% in 2023 to 71¢ in December 2023. Similarly, the EBITDA fell by 32.10% in 2023 to $3.3 billion. I think this shows why EBITDA and EPS are poor stock performance metrics.
