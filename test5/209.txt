MADISON MILLS: Time now for a look at some of the day's trending tickers as we approach the closing bell now on Wall Street. We're going to look at shares of Rivian riding higher as its vehicles will now be able to access the Tesla Supercharger network. Shares of both of these names both Rivian and Tesla up after that news.

With Tesla up about 6.5% and Rivian up a little over 3% here as we head into the end of the day. But this is kind of similar to Tesla's deal with Ford. Rivian owners are going to have access to that massive supercharger network by Tesla.

The largest DC fast-charging system with over 15,000 chargers. So definitely seen as a way to expand access to charging systems for these electric vehicles, Josh, which is a really important component when we continue to hear reports that consumers have struggled with finding ways to charge their electric vehicles. That's one of the reasons-- one of the reasons that we've seen companies like Hertz, for example, trying to offload these cars, along with the resale value going down over about eight years after the battery starts to stall there.

So it's interesting to see the street really rewarding both of these names for that charging capability.

JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, there was another headline here, too, Madi. I thought it was interesting. We did news at Tesla. I saw these reports is going to raise the price of its Model Y cars at least in the US and some European countries.

And you saw Tesla kind of move on that news. I do wonder if that's sort of helped give of general lift to broader EV stocks in today's trade as well.

MADISON MILLS: Well, Rivian also getting a little bit of a boon coming into Friday getting an upgrade off of offering some additional new products. That analysts were saying were just too cool to ignore. So you got to look at stuff like that, too. We're covering markets.
