While some high growth sectors such as high performance computing, cloud networks, and data centers have seen robust performance in 2024 particularly when artificial intelligence is thrown into the mix, others like clean energy have struggled in the changed global monetary environment.

The aftermath of the pandemic era government spending and the Russian invasion of Ukraine's effects on monetary policy has made it difficult for firms to find capital to fund their expensive manufacturing plants and for consumers to squeeze in pricey electric vehicle purchases in their budgets.

Coupled with instability in the raw material markets, particularly the one for lithium that has nearly stripped all incentives from mining companies to produce the battery metal, electric vehicle stocks are having a bumpy road on the market. As an example, consider three pure play EV stocks, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID), and NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO). Their share price performance year to date is affected by factors related to the U.S. electric vehicle market, the firms' business environment, and those present in China. The lackluster Chinese economic conditions are also responsible for the slowdown in lithium prices as a slowdown in EV demand in the country has meant that producers whose output is designed to match heavy demand sit with excess lithium on their hands, in a situation that's also called a glut.

For instance, the worst performing EV stock among these three is the Chinese firm NIO, whose shares are down by 30% year to date. This drop has been fueled by weakening analyst sentiment, with notable downgrades from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC). Both have downgraded NIO's shares, and BofA led the bank in January when it slashed NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO)'s shares to Neutral from Buy. Like JPMorgan's later downgrade to Underperform from Neutral, Bank of America analysts shared that a lack of new models will hinder the firm's ability to effectively compete in the cut throat Chinese electric vehicle industry. They also added that since NIO has yet to introduce new models, it might have to increase its marketing spending in the coming months and years. While spending on marketing is good, the BofA analysts believe that if NIO is also forced to cut its prices, then the lower revenue could constrain its margins.

Shifting focus on Tesla, its shares fell in 2022 and then recovered some of the losses last year. In 2024, the firm's shares tanked by 12% after its revenue of $25.17 billion and EPS of 71 cents ended up missing analyst estimates. This led short sellers to make billions of dollars according to some estimates, and the outlook was gloomy as the world's biggest pure play electric vehicle company warned that sales growth in 2024 could be slower.

Tesla was not the only electric vehicle stock that left investors thirsting for more in the wake of its fourth quarter earnings. Another such stock was Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN). The stock is down a whopping 47% year to date, after management shared during earnings that "challenging macro-economic conditions" would lead it to make 51,000 vehicles this year - a hefty drop from what analysts were expecting. However, Rivian investors were nevertheless comforted by the fact that the demand for its vehicles is solid, as evidenced by a revenue beat.

Looking at how these trends have affected EV stocks as a whole, the performance of the S&P Kensho Electric Vehicles Index provides us with a benchmark. Unsurprisingly, the index is down by 13% over the past twelve months. Over the past three years, the index is down by 23%, highlighting that while stocks such as Tesla have nevertheless posted some returns during the period, the broader EV sector has struggled in the era of high rates and high inflation. Narrowing down our EV stock index performance band to six, three, and one month, quarter to date, the index is down 6.9%, while over the month it is flat. The six month performance is -6%.
