Tesla (TSLA) has received a downgrade from Wells Fargo analyst Collin Langan, lowering the automaker's stock from Equal Weight to Underweight. In addition, Langan has significantly slashed Wells Fargo's price target on the stock to $125 per share, down from $200. The analyst's team cites concerns over Tesla's recent price cuts and potential EV delivery slowdowns, which it believes will drive further losses for the electric vehicle maker.

Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian breaks down the note to investors, providing an update on Tesla's Berlin gigafactory.

MADISON MILLS: Tesla shares edging lower this morning, down about 2% here after Wells Fargo downgrading the stock to underweight from equal weight. Also slashing its price target on the EV maker, the firm seeing some major headwinds for Tesla, noting disappointing deliveries and price cuts will likely drive negative EPS revisions here, and this comes after Tesla is already down a whopping 28% year to date. And we know from other guests that we've had on that this is a good play if you're looking at it like a car maker, right?

We've had Dan Ives say multiple times that folks in the US, at least the consumer, if they're looking for an EV, they're probably thinking that synonymous with a Tesla. So that's a good thing for this name, but if you're looking at it like a tech company and part of the Mag Seven, it's just not looking like it's part of that broader basket at this point.

SEANA SMITH: It certainly is not. I mean, take a look at these numbers. More than $220 billion has been wiped off its market cap since the start of the year. It's among the worst performers in the S&P, the stock falling 29% through yesterday's close. So making it one of the worst performers within the S&P since the start of the year. When you take a look at this note, and the call out from Wells Fargo, he doesn't expect Colin Langan there, the analyst doesn't expect the picture to really improve anytime soon for Tesla.

He actually calls it a growth company with no growth. He's pointing to their sales, the trends that they've seen play out over the last couple of quarters, saying that in the second half of 2023, from the first half, they only saw 3% in sales volumes, 3% growth in sales volumes. Prices were down 5%. Then when you look out to what he's expecting for this year and for next year, he expects sales volumes to be flat this year, and then to actually fall in 2025. So we talk about the fact that the EV market clearly not seeing the demand that many had anticipated.

You also have the price war that has played out, pressuring margins, and many of these companies. Yes, Tesla does have an advantage when it comes to margins versus the traditional automakers, but they're not immune to, obviously, the larger factors at play within the sector, and the fact that the demand is not there. At least from Wells Fargo's perspective, it's going to cap the movement here that we could see to the upside in the coming quarters.

MADISON MILLS: Well, it's such a great point, Seana. And they talk about how Ford did say that they were reassessing the electric vehicle plans. We also heard from Apple saying that they were winding down their electric car project after 10 years of investment, putting that money instead into generative AI, going along with that rally that we're seeing there. And it does look like, as of this morning, if we look at the boards that we just had up, Ford is up, while Tesla, obviously, continuing to struggle here.

We're also seeing General Motors up. General Motors scrapping the development of their sub $30,000 EVs. So interesting to see that the names that are slugging off their EV plays may be getting a little bit of upward motion here. Again, this Wells Fargo price target implies a 75% downside for Tesla. That is crazy.

SEANA SMITH: It is crazy, especially because so many people have been hyping up the name, obviously, over the last several months, very excited about the momentum that we saw play. A lot of this, though, driven by valuation. And he points out that even with the decline that we've seen in shares, the stock still trades at 55 times its forward earnings, compared to an average of about 31 for the Mag Seven. So it really puts that valuation question in perspective. But, again, Wells Fargo seeing more downside ahead for Tesla.
