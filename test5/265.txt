JARED BLIKRE: Time now for some trending tickers. Investors unplugging from Tesla this morning after reportedly reducing production at its China plant. That's according to Bloomberg. The report claims that the EV maker told Shanghai employees to cut back on production of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles by working five days a week instead of the typical 6 and 1/2. And Seana, first hats off to those people working 6 and 1/2 days per week over there.

I don't know the exact. I'm not trying to make light of this. But I think it's interesting because I was reading some broader stats about the car situation in China for overall passenger vehicle sales. That includes ICE, that includes EV. Those increased 17% in the first two months of the year. But Tesla is recording a decline in shipments from the same period a year ago. And I just think this speaks to the broader very competitive environment in which Tesla finds itself.

It's been a leader in terms of price cuts sometimes. But it's a two way street and it's just showing how difficult this very difficult market is, that being China.

SEANA SMITH: Yeah, exactly. And taking a look at this data here that we've got now from China's passenger Car Association of the first two months of the year like you were talking about sales actually declined for Tesla. They were down 6% compared to what we saw a year ago. And I bring this up because only 53% of the shipments went to the local market there in China.

And this comes despite the price cuts that you were just talking about there Jared, that Tesla has been carrying out really since the start of this year and we started to see play out at the end of last year. The increase in competition, the lower priced local players there has certainly made it tougher for Tesla to continue to make inroads into China. That paired with sluggish growth and also a struggling economy in China, has certainly been a headwind for Tesla and many of its competitors within that market.

And then coupling that up with what we're even seeing play out here in the US, you have many consumers who are staying on the sidelines. They're not buying EVs at the rate that they were expected to up until this point. And that's certainly been a huge reason why Tesla has been one of the worst performers within the S&P since the start of the year.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. Since you mentioned performance, let's go to the Wi-Fi interactive real quickly and just chart the year to date performance. And you can see, going the wrong direction upper left to the lower right. But we are in the midst of some larger trends here. And Tesla for its part, has been going sideways since-- what is this, since late 2022. That's a three year chart. If we put five year chart on, you can just see this is a lot of trendless action here that gets invited.

That gets investors excited to the upside and to the downside when we get some big levels. But we're closer to support than we are to resistance. So I got to think investors might want to think about at least trimming their exposure to the downside here maybe thinking about some longs but maybe a discussion for another day.
