The automobile market is expanding due to a shift toward EVs, government incentives, and technological advancements. Yet, challenges like disrupted supply chains, rising material costs, and regulatory concerns persist. So, it seems prudent to wait for a better entry point in Ford Motor Company (F) while avoiding struggling Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) could be wise.

The auto industry 2024 outlook is marked by economic headwinds, charging infrastructure concerns, and regulatory uncertainties. But S&P Global Mobility forecasts 88.3 million global new light vehicle sales in 2024, up 2.8% year-over-year. Also, battery electric passenger vehicle sales are expected to reach 13.3 million units, representing 16.2% of world passenger vehicle sales.

In addition, this year, the U.S. auto market is expected to return to normalcy with slow growth, increased new vehicle inventory, and declining transaction prices, while the electric vehicle segment sees expansion through incentives and advertising efforts.

Concurrently, the Biden-Harris Administration allocated $15.50 billion to aid the transition to electric vehicles, supporting factory retooling and job retention, with $2 billion in grants and up to $10 billion in loans for automotive manufacturing conversions and plans for a $3.50 billion investment in domestic battery manufacturing.

Further, the EV market is expanding rapidly due to government incentives and environmental concerns, with passenger cars leading the surge. Advanced battery technology and supportive policies are driving this growth, making electric vehicles increasingly attractive to consumers worldwide. The global EV market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 17.8% to reach $1.58 trillion by 2030.
