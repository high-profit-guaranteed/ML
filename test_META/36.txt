In the past five years, shares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) have climbed 149%. That's a solid return although it has been anything but a smooth ride. Shares tanked 64% in 2022 as investors became overly pessimistic about the company's prospects.

Where will this "Magnificent Seven" stock be in five years? To come up with an educated guess, I think it's worthwhile to consider what could change and what will stay the same.

During the three-month period that ended March 31, Meta reported having 3.24 billion daily active users across its family of apps. That includes some of the world's most popular social media services, like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. That user base, while already gargantuan, expanded by 7% year over year.
