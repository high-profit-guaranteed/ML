According to insider sources, Meta is working on another wearable product called "Camerabuds," in addition to the Meta Quest Pro and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.

These AI-powered headphones with built-in cameras are the company's latest foray into wearable technology.

The project, internally dubbed "Camerabuds," looks to combine advanced artificial intelligence and camera capabilities into a single headphone unit.

According to reports, Meta is investing substantial resources into this project, although it is still in the initial development stages. Despite having yet to finalize the form factor, Meta is reportedly committed to overcoming the technical challenges to bring this product to market.

Insider reports also suggest that the development team is figuring out a way to prevent the wearer's hair from obstructing the cameras. This technical hurdle is critical to maintaining the functionality and user experience of the Camerabuds.

Additionally, managing the heat generated by the onboard AI and camera components is a significant concern. Ensuring the hardware remains cool during use is essential to avoid user discomfort.

Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has reviewed several design prototypes but has not found a satisfactory version. This indicates that the project is still in an ongoing phase of iterative design and testing to refine the product.

While the Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses were well-received, other Meta hardware projects, such as a smartwatch and Portal smart speakers, were shelved.

Meta is developing "Camerabuds," AI-powered headphones with integrated cameras. Despite early development challenges, the project aims to enhance wearable technology, joining Meta's Quest Pro and Ray-Ban smart glasses.

The development of the Camerabuds comes at a time when artificial intelligence is increasingly integrated into consumer electronics. Meta's previous successes with AI-powered wearables, such as the Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses, provide a glimpse into the potential capabilities of the Camerabuds.

Similarly, Google's Project Astra has demonstrated the feasibility of combining AI with head-worn cameras.

However, integrating AI and cameras into headphones presents unique challenges. Onboard computing components can add volume and thermal mass to the device, potentially making it bulky - a problem echoed by critics of Apple's Vision Pro.

Other recent AI hardware products, such as the Rabbit R1 and Humane AI Pin, have faced issues like heating, similar to the challenges Meta addresses with the Camerabuds. Current Bluetooth standards may also fall short of supporting the real-time video transmission required by an AI assistant.

While the company declined to comment on the project, the ongoing investment and development efforts indicate that Meta is serious about bringing this product to market.
