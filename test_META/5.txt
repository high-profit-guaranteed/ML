Lyft has hired an industry veteran as its new CMO.

Brian Irving has over two decades of experience building and marketing iconic, global technology brands including Meta, Eventbrite, Airbnb, Google and Apple.

He replaces Felipe Avila, who was in the CMO role for less than seven months. Avila joined the ride share company in September 2023 and at the time, Lyft touted his 20 years of experience leading consumer brands, including The Container Store, where he directed brand strategy and reimagined the company’s loyalty program.

Avila posted on LinkedIn that he had left the company. He has not responded to a request for comment.

Irving also previously served as co-CMO and vice president of global digital marketing for Levi Strauss & Co.

Most recently, Irving spent the last three years as CMO and vice president of marketing at Meta Reality Labs. His LinkedIn page says that role ended in February.

During his 15 months at Airbnb, he helped orchestrate the “Live There” rebranding campaign that encouraged travelers to connect with hosts and immerse themselves in the neighborhoods while traveling.

He is a member of the board of directors at The Trevor Project, the leading nonprofit organization focused on suicide prevention among LGBTQIA+ youth.

“I grew up in the automotive industry [and was] always fascinated by helping people get places,” Irving says in a release. “And now, as a loyal Lyft rider for years, I get to meld my passion for transportation with the technology that helps riders and drivers alike.”
