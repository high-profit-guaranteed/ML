Electric vehicle challenger brand Rivian is bringing in a Meta executive as its top marketer.

Jennifer Prenner will lead Rivian's marketing activities worldwide, which include continuing to foster loyalty with customers and fans in addition to reaching new audiences, according to a company post on LinkedIn.

Rivian’s last top marketing officer was Laura Schwab, whose title was vice president of sales and marketing. She held the position from November 2020 to October 2021. She was critical of the automaker’s “boys club” culture and filed a lawsuit against Rivian for gender discrimination and retaliation, according to an Autoweek story.

Prenner joins Rivian with over 20 years of business, marketing, product and operations leadership experience.

She has spent the past three years as vice president, global marketing for Meta, where she led a team of product marketers and general managers across the Reality Labs portfolio. The products she led included virtual reality, augmented reality, extended reality, Portal and Metaverse.

Prenner previously served as Amazon's global head of marketing, growth and customer engagement for the Fire TV business.

"I am excited to join Rivian as we work to achieve even more success by building out a high performing marketing team to share the passion that current customers already have.” Prenner says in the Rivian post.

Prenner took a gap year in between jobs. She plans to add to her team at Rivian, where her title is vice president, marketing.

“After an amazing sabbatical year, life couldn’t have smiled on me more than with this opportunity,” she posts on her own LinkedIn page. “I’m so excited by the mission, the opportunity ahead and all of the amazing people I’ve already met. Plus, I’ll be hiring so if you’re looking to make the world a better place, one amazing adventure vehicle at a time, reach out!”
