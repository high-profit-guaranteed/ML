A meta-analysis of 173 studies involving nearly 900,000 COVID-19 patients in more than 50 countries finds that 42.9% were infected with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), which the authors say underscores the urgent need for stronger antimicrobial stewardship strategies.

The study, led by Sun Yat-sen University researchers in China, was published in the Journal of Infection.

The investigators systematically reviewed studies published from December 2019 to May 2023 on the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and antibiotic use among COVID-19 patients.

Antibiotic resistance was categorized according to the World Health Organization (WHO) priority list, and antibiotics were classified according to the WHO's Access, Watch, or Reserve (AWaRe) system.

Of the 892,312 patients, 42.9% had an MDRO infection, with 41.0% testing positive for carbapenem-resistant pathogens, 19.9% for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 24.9% for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms, and 22.9% for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) species.

A total of 76.2% of patients were prescribed antibiotics, 29.6% with Watch antibiotics, 22.4% with Reserve antibiotics, and 16.5% with Access drugs.

Macrolides were the most commonly prescribed category of antibiotics (34.7%), followed by glycopeptides (33.1%) and third-generation cephalosporins (31.5%). The most commonly used antibiotics were azithromycin (46.2%), ceftriaxone (38.3%), and vancomycin (34.7%).

MDRO prevalence and antibiotic use were significantly greater in low- and middle-income countries than in wealthier countries, with the lowest proportion of antibiotic use (60.1%) and MDRO prevalence (29.1%) in North America. The highest MDRO prevalence was in the Middle East and Africa (63.9%), and the greatest proportion of antibiotic use was in South Asia (92.7%). Antibiotic use and intensive care unit admission were significant predictors of higher MDRO prevalence.

The results underscore "the formidable challenge facing global efforts to prevent and control AMR amidst the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic," the researchers wrote. "These findings serve as a crucial warning to policymakers, highlighting the urgent need to enhance antimicrobial stewardship strategies to mitigate the risks associated with future pandemics."
