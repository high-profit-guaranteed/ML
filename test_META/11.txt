Meta Quest platforms will once again stream 20 live Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) games this season, with five ‘immersive’ streams offering 180-degree virtual reality (VR) for the first time.

All games covered by the partnership will be available in Meta’s Horizon Worlds and Xtadium applications.

The league agreed a multi-year partnership extension with Meta last year, with the Meta Quest becoming the WNBA’s official virtual reality (VR) headset.

The slate of 20 matches began with the Dallas Wings’ victory over the Chicago Sky on 15th May. Caitlin Clark’s Indiana Fever will feature in two games, with the first coming on 22nd May against the Seattle Storm.

Meta also has a partnership with the National Basketball Association (NBA), having signed a multi-year agreement with the men’s league last year. The deal led to the creation of the VR fan experience ‘NBA Arena’, which is found in Meta Horizon Worlds.

Meanwhile, Sports Media Watch reports that the 1st June matchup between the Fever and the Sky has been moved from NBA TV to ESPN. The highly anticipated game will see Clark and the Sky’s Angel Reese, who both became national names in college basketball, square off against each other.

Last year’s Women’s March Madness tournament saw Clark’s Iowa Hawkeyes face Reese’s LSU at the Elite Eight stage. The game recorded 12.3 million viewers for ESPN, which set a record for the network at the time.

Earlier this week, Clark’s regular season debut for the Fever on 15th May averaged 2.12 million viewers on ESPN2, which was the WNBA’s most watched game in 23 years.
