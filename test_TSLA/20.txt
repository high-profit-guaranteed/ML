Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has won its bid to extend its Berlin factory into a nearby forest despite receiving heavy pushback from environmental activists.

Local councillors in Gruenheide voted in favour for the extension of the gigafactory, German reports revealed.

Activists have been protesting the plans since February over fears the construction could affect water supplies and cause deforestation.

Last week, hundreds of activists were seen storming the site after the police were unable to keep them at bay.

In March, protestors launched an arson attack which cut power off for the facility and caused production to be suspended. It also left hospitals and homes without electricity.

Despite the decision, a court has ruled that the police are not allowed to demolish any treehouses that activists have built in the trees near the site.

Tesla plans to open a freight depot and add logistical space with the extension but had to compromise on felling fewer trees to get it approved.
