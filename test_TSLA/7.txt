Tesla, Inc. TSLA has been on the move lately as the stock has risen by 25.9% in the past four weeks, and it is currently trading well above its 20-Day SMA. This is a pretty solid move higher, but the question that has to be on investors’ minds right now is; can this trend continue?

While there can be no telling for sure, it is certainly encouraging that earnings estimates have risen in the past few weeks on the company, suggesting that sentiment on TSLA is moving in the right direction. In fact, the stock currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggesting that the recent run could certainly continue for this in-focus company. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.

And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.
