Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been developing plans for a data center in China to train the algorithm it would need to have fully autonomous vehicles operating in the region, according to Reuters. Sources indicate the electric vehicle giant has had talks with Nvidia (NVDA) about acquiring graphic processing units for a China data center.

The use of a data center could be a shift in strategy from trying to attempt to convince authorities in China to approve the transfer of data generated by its EVs in China to out of the country to improve the Full Self Driving system. While Hyundai (OTCPK:HYMTF), Mazda (OTCPK:MZDAY), Toyota Motor (TM), Volkswagen (OTCPK:VLKAF) and Nissan (OTCPK:NSANY) currently have approval to transfer some of their data out of China, none of those automakers have specific approvals for data that could be used to train AI systems.

Tesla (TSLA) could boost its revenue and margins in China if it were to find a workaround to offer the full version of FSD in China.

Shares of Tesla (TSLA) were up 0.18% in premarket trading on Friday. The EV stock is down close to 30% on a year-to-date basis. Short interest stands at 3.9% of the total float.
