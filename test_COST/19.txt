Kansas Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt has released data on the amount paid by insurance companies for Kansas storm damage claims in 2023.

"The Kansas Department of Insurance collects this data yearly to better understand the impact of storm events across Kansas," said Schmidt. "This data is important to help the department monitor trends in the marketplace."

In 2023, storm claims totaled 147,710 and the amount paid out on those claims by insurance companies was $442,822,099.11.

The department collected the data from all companies writing property and casualty insurance in Kansas. This data includes the number of total claims as well as the amount paid for those claims across several types of storm losses including hail, wind, water damage and other weather-related claim losses for homeowner and automobile policies.

Johnson County saw the highest amount while Greeley County saw the lowest. A county-by-county breakdown of the data can be found on the department's website.
