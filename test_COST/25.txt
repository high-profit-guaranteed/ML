“No Cost” Lunches Set To End For Some Rob. Co. Schools

ROBERTSON COUNTY TENNESSEE: (Smokey Barn News) – In a continued effort to ensure that all Robertson County Schools students have access to nutritious meals, Roberton County Schools will re-institute a meal pricing structure for the upcoming school year.

The district has provided meals at no cost to all students for the past 2 years despite economic challenges, and while having to reestablish pricing, those prices will remain unchanged from 2012, continuing to offer genuine value to families.

Last year alone, the district’s nutrition program absorbed $700,000 to continue providing meals without increasing costs to families. Regrettably, maintaining these programs without adjustments is simply no longer sustainable.

Prior to COVID pandemic relief funding, elementary school lunches were $2.25, a middle school lunch was $2.50, and high school lunches were $2.75. Lunches will be provided next school year at those same rates, which have remained consistent for more than a decade.

Additionally, every student district-wide will continue to receive breakfast at no cost, a benefit that has also been in place for many years, and which demonstrates the district’s commitment to student well-being. This initiative, which began around 2015, will continue to ensure that students start their day with a nutritious meal, fueling their learning and growth.

In addition to breakfast at no cost, the district has expanded its nutrition support through the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP). This year, 14 schools,* including recently-added Jo Byrns High and Watauga Elementary, will provide both breakfast and lunch at no cost to all students, thanks to CEP. The ability of a school to participate in this program is determined by criteria provided by the United States Department of Agriculture.

Families in all other schools who think they may qualify for reduced-price meals are encouraged to fill out applications. These forms will be mailed to every household at the end of July and are also available online on the district’s webpage. Completing these applications not only helps individual families but also impacts the overall eligibility of schools for additional support, thereby benefiting the entire community.

The district remains dedicated to providing affordable, healthy meals to its students. The unchanged meal prices reflect a long-standing commitment to supporting families and ensuring that every student has the nourishment they need to succeed.
