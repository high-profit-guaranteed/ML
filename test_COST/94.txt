Suspensions were a bit too common in the NBA back in the late 90s, and 2000s. But avoiding one in the playoffs was of utmost importance to the players considering their paychecks could take a hit. Unfortunately for Robert Horry, the former San Antonio Spurs forward couldn’t help but fall prey to the league’s rules after his mild physical altercation with Steve Nash during the 2007 NBA playoffs, getting himself suspended. Horry was furious about the suspension, but the highlight was his stern warning to the league and the referees.

In game 4 of the Western Conference Semi-Finals between the Phoenix Suns and the San Antonio Spurs, Robert Horry shoved Steve Nash in the final few seconds in an attempt to foul him. Unintentionally, the contact from Horry had greater force than expected which led to a flagrant foul. This led to a brawl mid-game and players from both the Suns and the Spurs were suspended. One of them was Horry, who received a two-game suspension for the physical contact.

However, that was not the worst part. Horry’s suspension cost him a playoff check worth $60,000. In his podcast Big Shot Bob, the Los Angeles Lakers legend shared, “Quote unquote, the shove at Steve Nash, I got a two-game suspension. It cost me $60,000…my playoff check. I told the guy who fined me, ‘I’m gonna be watching every f****** game. If you don’t f****** throw guys out or suspend guys for a game for the s*** I did, Imma sue the f****** league.”

Horry believes his foul on Nash was not bad, but on the other hand, the Suns believed the play was “dirty“. It led to a lot of exchange of words, and the league’s decision surprisingly turned favorable for the Spurs.

The Suns were the scapegoat despite Horry’s

Spurs did not have Horry for the rest of the series, but the Suns had two of their main players suspended due to this brawl. Amare Stoudemire and Boris Diaw of the Suns were given a one-game suspension which cost the Suns big time. They lost to the Spurs 88-85 in game 5, and later in game 6 as well, although the above two stars returned.

Stoudemire and Diaw were suspended for leaving “the immediate vicinity of their bench“, which the Suns thought was unfair. Former owner of the Suns, Robert Sarver, told the media, “The way this worked out for us, it was, I believe, extremely unfair…The team that plays dirty should not be rewarded and the team that plays fair should not be penalized.” At the end of the day, this brawl favored the San Antonio Spurs, as the Suns lost 4-2.
