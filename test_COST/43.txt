No-cost health services are being provided to folks living in and around the city of Kodiak.

People in Kodiak and its surrounding villages are getting access to medical, dental, optometry and veterinary services. It's all through a program called Kodiak Arctic Care.

The U.S. Department of Defense and the Kodiak Area Native Association are behind the effort, serving as a valuable training mission for our troops.

"We use that training to provide that value at no cost to the community, provide those healthcare services to folks that may not have the opportunity otherwise, where the healthcare infrastructure isn't as robust as it may be in larger metropolitan areas. So we go out there to those often rural or remote places like Kodiak and plus up their existing healthcare capabilities," explained Capt. David Falcon with the New York Air National Guard.
