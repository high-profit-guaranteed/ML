Father warns of illicit drugs cut with fentanyl in pill form

Loveland, Ohio – Tom Quehl is the co-founder of the Jack Quehl Foundation and the father to Jack Quehl, who died of fentanyl poisoning in 2021. Jack Quehl was 24 years old. He and his wife, Stephanie Quehl, now share Jack’s story and others’ to raise awareness.

Tom Quehl made an appearance on NewsNation with Kelsey Kernstine to discuss the rising prevalence of fentanyl laced pills.

“With the shortage of Adderall and Xanax out there, they’re trying to fight depression or ADHD, and they’re reaching out to the street, and they’re finding drugs that are laced with fentanyl,” Tom Quehl said. “And if it’s not killing them … they’re getting something that has a different taste to it, and now they become an addict and a regular customer. And that spiral is something I don’t want to see.”
