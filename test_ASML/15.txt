The company’s former president, Daniel Wu, along with a majority shareholder, Jeffrey Koo Jr, joined CTBC’s board of directors yesterday

CTBC Financial Holding Co (中信金) yesterday appointed majority shareholder Jeffrey Koo Jr (辜仲諒) and former company president Daniel Wu (吳一揆) as board directors.

The board also appointed Wu as the group’s vice chairman.

The leadership reshuffles confirmed earlier media speculations that Koo would rejoin the company’s boardroom after being acquitted of charges involving alleged contraventions of the Securities and Exchange Act (證券交易法) and the Banking Act (銀行法).

The charges embroiled Koo for more than a decade and cost him his position as vice chairman of Chinatrust Financial Holding Co, which his father, Jeffrey Koo Sr (辜濂松), founded in 2002. The conglomerate changed its formal title to CTBC Financial in 2013.

Koo Jr would continue to promote sports and charity events, as he has been doing as head of CTBC Charity Foundation (中國信託慈善基金會), local Chinese-language media said.

A board seat would help Koo Jr regain membership at the Third Wednesday Club, a major trade group, and vie for its chairman’s seat in June. This would allow him to promote Taiwan’s international presence via economic and trade venues, as his father did.

Jeffrey Koo Sr had served as ambassador-at-large between 1998 and 2012, taking part in APEC and other important international meetings on behalf of Taiwan.

Local media said Jeffrey Koo Jr has no intention of taking the helm at CTBC Financial.

CTBC Bank (中國信託銀行) chairman Morris Li (利明?) yesterday tendered his resignation, which is to take effect on Friday next week.

The bank’s vice chairman Austin Chan (詹庭禎) would take over the chairmanship during the transition.
